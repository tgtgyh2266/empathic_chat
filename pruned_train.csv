"Job interviews always make me sweat bullets, makes me uncomfortable in general to be looked at under a microscope like that.  Don't be nervous. Just be prepared. I feel like getting prepared and then having a curve ball thrown at you throws you off.  ",Yes but if you stay calm it will be ok.
"I lost my job last year and got really angry. I am sorry to hear that. Did it happen out of the blue? Yes, it was a complete surprise.",I am sorry to hear that. I hope it turned out to be a blessing in decise.

"What a difference a year makes. Last year one evening my family was at home when a tree fell on the house and broke through the ceiling. That's very scary. I hope no one got hurt.

We were out of the house for five months while repairs were being done, but now the house is better than ever.",So good to hear. Might want to trim some trees lol
"Hi, I have a co work always asking me questions about how to use her mobile. It is almost always the same questions. It must be so frustrating to have to answer the same thing over and over. Is she older? Yes, she is. She is telling that all the cell phone that she has been using have deleting her contacts.","My aunt does the same thing! I think what she is doing is accidentally deleting texts, and she doesn't understand how to check her contacts list. What do you think is happening with your co-worker?"
I worked on my truck all weekend. Spent $215 on parts and a special tool. Still did not fix the miss in the engine. What is the problem with the engine? It has a miss.

Hello Hello! I am in such a good mood since I got my new home. Funny - we just built a house where we used to go camping when I was a kid.  I have a ton of backyard space that we have plans for.

"I could not tolerate the waiters insensitivity,that's poor service indeed! What happened? Imagine ,I requested a French fries ,but was served burger instead!",It is very bad service. What did you do? Did you complain to the manager?
"I left his house, filled up with his food and disgust. I left his fridge completely empty and feel guilth That would be hard to do and take courage.  Thanks man, at the heat of the moment I ate due to my flashbacks I was traumised.",I could see that happening but sounds like you were super brave.
"Hi I was recently on vacation and frightened half to death. Oh, my, what happened? I was eating some chips on the balcony. I dropped them and then was swarmed by seagulls.

I donr know how dangerous they are but I didnt want to fall 7 stories.",I heard a story of seagulls drowning a man to death.

The internet is the future and very many jobs are opening up online. ",She is 13 not at 3am
One of my friend didn't keep this promise he made to me. I was so angry to him. What promise didn't he keep? I was suppose to help me move from my apartment. He didn't come and turned off his cell phone.,Wow that sounds like a terrible friend.  I hope he had a good reason for not showing up.

"I went shopping yesterday and bought a $2000 bag. My husband is going to kill me.. Haha my girlfriend does the same thing.  Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks, then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories.   All women have the same problem. It is a guilty pleasure..",We all deserve to treat ourselves every now and then.
I hate to be tired and see a store crowded with customers and only one or two checkouts open. Yeah it's really frustrating when they won't have more eople on.  Especially when it's a time of day that they know will be crowded and busy. ,Exactly. Hopefully more places will get self-checkout so we can get through the line faster. 
"There was a person who had to do twice the amount of work that they usually do. Sounded like they need to fire whoever didn't do their job  Yeah, or at least do something to correct that. Maybe there should be a training day where they do back over everything,  or hire more people maybe also That too! If only",They don't spend money unless they absolutely have to. They get bonuses for saving money I think
So our new manager has changed our bonus structure causing us to never hit bonus.. And then what? Its frustrating when I go from 24 an hour to 10 an hour because of his lies. ,"I understand, that must suck"
"I had a chance to make some money, but my phone screwed up Thats terrible... have you gotten a new phone yet?  yes i did, but i still can not get that money","Thats true, but I hope some good luck comes your way soon.."
"i bumped into a car while reversing, i had to wait long to talk to owner of the other car Oh no, that's terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that.

"Hi, I am concerned about the financial situation of my employer. Have  you thought about talking to your boss about it? I don't think it is a good idea. There was a layout off six month ago. ",You should still speak to him about your concerns.
So I am home from work and Marks car was outside. I went in and him and Liz were kissing on the couch. This is terrible. So sad to hear that. What did you do then? I made them both leave but me and Liz are breaking up.  ,Did she already move out?
Did you go outside and see if anyone was hurt? What do you mean? I don't know what you are talking about. I heard a noise outside that sounded like a car had wrecked yesterday.,Well then I guess you should have went and checked to see if anyone was hurt. I hope you called a ambulance.
So after I left the club last night I noticed the Taxi had old throw up in it still. I would have gotten out right then I believe. I still took it since it was late but I rode in the front seat. ,I guess you rolled all the windows down too and held your breath
"The other day when I was cleaning I came across an old keychain my dad gave me when I was younger, it was nice to see.  Thats good that you found the keychain Yeah it meant a lot to me - almost like a sign! ",that's very good! Always nice to find those old lost items.

i am angry against a friend that suppose to help me. That sucks... what was he or she supposed to help you with?  I wanted to wall mount my TV but my friend didn't come and turned off his cell phone. I was always helping him for anything.,"Well I hope you two can talk it out, express your feelings and work it out together! Friendship is hard to come by these days... "
So we had a meeting at work this week. Turns out we may have to shut down in the next few months. Omg... thats terrible! Im so sorry - Ive been through similar. Are they going to give you some sort of money upon lay off?  I feel like if they go through with it they have to offer us packages right? ,If they have a heart or soul they will! They really should...
"I am afraid my neighbors are causing snakes to come over my way. What are they doing to cause you to think that?

"Recently, I have been annoyed by a coworker making jokes about me. Shame on them. It is bothering me a lot. This coworker is not competent and he spend this time making jokes on other people.",You should report him. Anonymously. You should't have to deal with that every day.
"I really dislike my neighbors. They are the worst. What are they doing that is upsetting you? They argue constantly and we live in apartments so I can hear everything. They even call the police a lot. Have you made a formal complaint against them yet? Yes, but I think they know the landlord.",You should report it to your local police department. Building and documenting this can help you.

It sounded too good to be true honestly it made me feel a little uneasy... i had to turn it down! ,"yes, i understand. sometimes you just get a gut feeling that something isn't right"
Last night I went into my kitchen and ate all of my kids cookies. I do that all of time. Well my wife confronted me this morning and I blamed it on our dog Max. Lol. Poor Max.

I bet it was pricey. "
"My grandmother passed away unexpectedly a few years ago. oh no sorry to hear that. I just lost mine in November. It's hard. Yes it is. She was the grandparent I was closest to.

"I went to the optometrist, and my prescription got strong. She warned me about being at risk for losing my vision. That's not good.

"So, last night I thought I was Martha Stewart and tried out a new recipe I crafted - pepperoni cheesecake A+ for creativity. Oh, believe me, I thought so as well. Turns out, pepperoni was never meant for cheesecake. I promptly threw it in the trash with disappointment.","Never ventured, nothing gained and all."
It irritates me when my roommate doesn't clean up after himself I hate that too! Do you make him clean it up? I say something and he just gets all grumbly and then it's uncomforatable.,That's a tough situation to be in. I would just take all his belongings to the dump and be done with it. Maybe he can stay there too.
"Went to Hawaii for vacation. Kinda felt like it was a waste of money. Really? Why? I felt bored the entire time I was there, and anything I did there could be done at home.",I don't like vacations that make you feel like you are still at home. Where do you live?
"I once had people pass right by a little chihuahua on a hot day when they needed help Awwwww, poor little doggie. Did you end up helping the poor thing? Yes! He was in front of a grocery store..so hot! and so many passed by and he was asking for help. He got a great home! ",That's good! Small dogs like that make excellent companions. Do you plan on keeping him?
"My friend's mom isn't doing too well. That's too bad to hear. What's wrong with her? She fell suddenly, had to get surgery and now she hasn't woken up from it.",That's incredibly awful. At least the surgery fixed the injury (I assume). Did the doctors say when she is going to wake up?
"Last night, I did the most unfortunate thing. I ate three entire bags of Totinos 250 count pizza rolls. Think I've done that, too. No regrets, my friend. At the time it seemed like a brilliant idea. But afters, I felt like a disgusting blob. God bless the Great and Noble Lord Totino.",They are tasty sins.
The weekend was so chill and quiet. Now my kids are back are they being loud and annoying like usual? Yes. I think they have gotten even louder since they left Saturday. Geez.,"Ugh, well good think mine are still at summer camp."
"Yesterday, my brother committed the unforgivable crime of eating the last twinkie. Oh no, how dare he! Doesn't he know that is forbidden It is! I was so jealous that I didn't get to even taste a single one.",That's so sad :( Maybe he should buy you a substitute
Found someone's scarf the other day and returned it to her. She completely bawled. that was nice of you It was just a scarf. Didn't think it would have such value for her.,it could have been sentimental. like a gift from someone special
I was using the bathroom on a train in rome. I didnt lock the door properly and a woman walked in on me. She laughed. Wow. How'd that go? Not good. I stayed in the bathroom and got off at the next stop.,That must've been embarassing. Happens to us all.
My friend hasnt been feeling well lately. That's too bad. What seems to be wrong with him? His heart has been beating real fast lately.,Doesn't sound good at all. Has anyone taken him to get it checked out?
"Last night was quite a low point in my life. I ordered 12 Big Mac's from the drive thru of McDonalds. Big Mac's are heaven in your mouth. They are, but I felt so ashamed. Not because I ate so much, but because I didn't order enough.","I mean you can still go back for more after this. Don't give up, bro."
"Last night was an incredibly low point in my life. I went dumpster diving for food at my local Burger King.  I'm sorry to hear that, what led you to this? I've been in massive debt since I lost two million dollars to a Nigerian Prince. Figures that email was too good to be true.","Yea, you need to stay away from those, especially if you don't know who they are, your email should be able to block stuff like that, look in the settings."
"At work, I am often the only employee in my building. Why is that? It's a small company and the other folks in my department just work part time.  ","Oh wow, you must have a lot of responsibility there!"
School is about to start. I can't wait Are you attending post secondary? Im in college. My kids are goin back too ,That's awesome! What are you and your kids taking?
"Yesterday, I was crossing the street and the person in front of me was hit by car which didn't stop at the red light O no! That's a terrible thing to have happen or see. Now, I am so scared to cross streets. I am always paying attention.",Was the person ok?
I have an important job interview and i am nervous about it. Oh! What is it for? Just remember to think of all your good qualities and the interviewers :) It is just for an awesome job i have always dream to have it.,Cool! What industry is it in? I hope you get the job!
I am not in the best city and walking around the other night for a nice walk- someone kept following me. What city are in right now? In a city in michigan. One of the top dangerous cities in the USA ,"Oh well, be carreful.Make sure nobody is following you."
I am so ashamed. I wasted 300 on an exercise bike Oh wow. Well are you going to use it? Why are you ashamed? I never use it and I don't think I ever will ,Why did you buy it then?
"Yesterday, I saw a woman in the bus that her lollipop felt on the floor. She took the lollipop, clean it, remove a hair that was on it and put it back in her mounth. That is so disgusting! I start to watch in the other direction because I was going to throw up.",I probably would have done the same thing.
"I feel so alone now that I'm single. Don't feel bad, many people are experiencing the same feelings.  Try to focus on meeting new and interesting people! I have but it never works out. All of my friends are married now. ",Have you tried online dating?  Many of my friends have experienced success with apps like eharmony!
"I was so mad at my coworker. He left for an extended work deployment and I inherited all his unfinished work. That's not fair. Why didn;t they split it up with more people. You would think they would, but no.  What makes it worse, is my coworker knew I was being left with his stuff and he made no attempt to close anything out!",That's terrible. Maybe you can get a promotion if you get it all done.
"I lied to my girlfriend once about how much education I had because I felt she would leave me otherwise Did you ever come clean? Yeah, I had to. It was too big of a secret. We had a really, really long talk. But she loves me for me, so she was able to accept it, and I've started working towards almost finishing the education I lied about having in the first place.",That's good. I always like about not understanfing football when I meet a guy. It makes them feel good lol
"I lost my dog the other day. They were my best friend since 12. Don't know what I'm going to do.. I am so sorry.  Our pets are not just pets... they are part of our family.  Go through the grieving process, even if it takes time.  You deserve that. i really appreciate that. It'll be hard... Especially for my son. He doesn't really understand that they're not coming back, since he's just 2",That is difficult.  My son didn't experience until age 10.
I can't afford a new car. Are you deep in debt with medical expenses? Deep in debt and poor. ,Have you considered talking to a debt counselor?
"I wasted beer all over myself at a party the other night. That sounds like a sticky, stinky mess. It was all over me and I had no way to get it dry. ",What did you do?
It is nights like this when I am alone that I will cherish when I start back to school.  But tonight seems a bit lonely with no one around. Sorry to hear that. I'm in the same boat. At least I have two dogs with me. Do you have any friends around No but I too have a dog that is great company.,"Yeah, they can be. Except these guys get really rowdy when there's a thunderstorm (like there will be tonight, sadly...). What about yours?"
I really get scared when I am around dogs. Some dogs can be very intimidating. I can understand that. Did something bad happen? I got bite by a dog when I was little.,That can be traumatizing to a young person. I hope you can one day overcome your fear. Most dogs are very friendly.
So I have something to admit. I ate the rest of a co-workers sandwich the other day. I havent told anyone. Not my proudest moment. That isn't nice. Yea I know. Someone ate my lunch last week and I remember how mad I was. I know that is not a good enough excuse for what I did. Im feeling pretty bad about it right now.,That isn't nice.
"My kids are so terrible sometimes. That's rough. I've been around my siblings kids long enough to know how rough they can be, even though I don't have my own. How old are they, if you don't mind me asking? 3 and 4. They came running in here and wasted my last Dr Pepper.  ","Dang.. I love Dr. Pepper too. They can be selfish sometimes, but we just have to remember that they have developed the parts of their brain to make them care about more than just themselves."
"My apartment is getting infested with bugs. I'm not so sure we'll be able to get rid of them entirely.. That is horrible. I would hate to have to deal with that when it's not my fault. Yeah, not a lot you can do when they just come from other apartments, even if you kill them in yours. It's gross to think about.","Yeah, they do have those sticky traps that you can put out to catch them once they spray really good. We dealt with roaches before, but got rid of them."
Stepped in dog poop and tracked it all throughout my parent's house because I didn't know I had done it. Then I had too clean it up. Really annoying... When did this happen? Happened earlier today! The house still stinks.,You should buy some spray.
I am really worried I will let my father down. Why would you think that? Cause I usually mess up.,Try hard not too. That's the best you can do
"Ate the last biscuit this morning during breakfast. Then my child came in asking for another one and I felt really bad. Oh well. Maybe I'll get her something as a treat tomorroow. It really makes a parent feel bad when that happens. I live with what my neighbor calls mom guilt. Hah. Yeah, I'm the same way. But sometimes it's hard to plan how much they want to eat!",very difficult. If you hadn't eaten it the child most likely wouldn't have wanted it.
"Didn't get to exercise today. I feel like I'm lazy You can still exercise now. It's almost 9, and I still have work to do. I want to go jogging, but I don't think I have time :(","You should do it, even 15 minutes."
I wish I had  more friends. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you struggle to communicate with people? I am very sky.,"Shy? Yeah, I get that. I was too, until I started getting out more. The ability to socialize is a muscle you have to work at."
"When I was a kid, I was pulling water from well in my grand father house. When the bucket was out of the well, a live snake was floating inside of it. that's crazy. Snakes are one of my worst fears. Was it poisonous, do you know? No, I started shouting. I was so scared.",Hah. I would have to. I would have booked it the second I saw it. People could prank me easily with fake snakes if they wanted to.
"Its frustrating to get paid less than other people when you are doing their job Wow, you are? How did you find out? They were just being lazy, and the work had to get done, so I had to do it ","What do you do, if you don't mind me asking?"
"Even though they're in their 60s and have been together for the past 30 years, my mom and dad still get giddy around each other. Makes me happy Thats really awesome that they are still so much in love.  do you have a significant other? I do! We've been together for six years. I still feel the same way about her as I did the first day. How about you?","Awesome! my wife and I got married 2 years ago, I hope we make it 30 years like your parents!"
"I am so tired of cleaning dirty diapers. I hear you. I've had to change the diapers of my nieces and nephews for the past 15 years, as they've come and gone. MY son is 3 1/2 those are baby poops. He refuses to use the potty though. ",I've never potty trained them. At what age does that normally happen? 3?
"I can't believe I used salt instead of sugar in the cake I baked. Whoaa.... You probably had to throw that away immediately, huh? Don't worry, my sister-in-law forgot to put eggs in a cake one time and it came out like a brick. Yes, it was a disaster.","Well, you live and you learn. At least you can bake, or try to. I don't hardly cook at all, besides simple things!"
"My bus didn't show up on time and I had stand out in the rain for an extra 20 minutes earlier. That's odd... Usually buses are always on time. Maybe the weather had something to do with it. I'm sorry to hear that happened to you. All dried off now? I'm on a pretty bad bus line, though it would make sense if it was the weather. Yes, all dried off now, thanks!",Glad to hear it. Hopefully you didn't have any electronics with you... That would be my worst nightmare!
It's such a bummer that I did badly on the job interview I had today. I'm sorry. Are you sure you did that bad? I am and I prepared so much for it! It's all quite upsetting.,They'll be other interviews.
Every good show on tv is ending or has already ended. What shows are you thinking of specifically? Game of thrones is the top one. I want it to last forever ,I didn't realize it was ending? You must be disappointed.
"I was scared the other night when I heard several gunshots in a row. Oh wow, I hope you are fine! I am. I am in a very dangerous neighborhood so you just never know if it's going to get you and the police don't show up. ","Yikes. If I was you, I would get my own gun! Better to have it and not need it, then have not have it then need it!"
"I am upset Brian Lawyer died. Oh that's horrible. Who's Brian Lawyer? He was a WWE wrestler. I've never heard of him, but that sucks. How'd he die? He hung himself.",Oh wow that's horrible.
I spend way too much money on food. That's a tough one. Do you eat out a lot? That's usually the culprit. I had to learn how to cook for myself so I could afford to live. I get food delivered several times a week. It's terrible. ,"Oh man, that's doubly terrible! Yeah, if you can, you should try to make a budget and get better at cooking for yourself. Huge money saver, but I'm sure you already knew that. I hope it works for you, though."
"My dad just passed away. Even though I haven't lived near him to be able to see him often in a long time, I really feel his missed presence. It just feels... strange I'm sorry to hear that, I hope he is in a better place now! How old was he? He was only 67. He struggled with a heart condition most of his life. Thanks for the kind words.","Oh wow, I can't imagine losing my dad at 67. I hope you make it through these hard times, stay strong!"
"I recently got caught speeding and lied to the cop about why, so he let me go. I feel kind of guilty/ Yeah, everyone speeds. Terrible to get caught. Hopefully you weren't speeding in a neighborhood, were you? No, it was a highway and I wasn't going much over the limit. I still felt bad, though. I don't know why I lied, it just came out!","Yeah, I know. Adrenaline gets to you. You're human. At least you were doing it in a sort of safe way, it sounds like. Some cops are just out to get you."
just heard a thump upstairs in a house I'm house sitting all alone at. Really don't want to go check it out Don't go check it out. That never turns out well in horror movies. Bring a gun then or another person. I don't have a gun! Or another person! Ah man... Guess I'll just sleep in the bathroom with the door locked,I would do that! Or call a friend over- Get a weapon too.
"My coworker made a mistake and blamed it on me! Seriously? How? What was the mistake? Did you talk to him about it, or your boss? He used my computer to put in his notes for a ticket he messed up on so it was under my name and not his!",That's sneaky... and hard to explain. I'm sorry you have to deal with that hard situation. What do you think you'll do about it?
"Sitting next to my baby brother who's two-years-old, and he's just ripping farts. Really wish I didn't have to stay with my parents during the summer while college is out Wap you must be disgusted with the farting. were you mad? or are you used to this kind of situations? Kind of used to it.Comes with the territory of being with a kid brother. How about you? Any siblings?","Yes i do have 2 siblings, older brother and younger sister, but we dont fart in front of eachother, i love them!"
I've been pretty pissed off about the slow internet speeds lately. I think it's the weather?  Who knows.. I've dealt with slow internet all my life. Wish I could finally get a decent ISP. I think it's time to get a new ISP! Any recommendations?,"Not really, especially since they vary sometimes by region. We should just move to Europe, I hear they have great internet there because they actually view it as important."
I have bad panic attacks about death after experiencing so much of it the past year I am so sorry to hear that. I assume lots of folks close to you have entered eternity lately? Yes people and pets. Too soon. So it definitely makes you think everyone is going to die any minute and life is meaningless. ,"sadly we all know that everyone and everything is going to die, but that is why we need to really live while we are able. Don't retreat. Embrace everyone who is close to you."
"I couldn't sleep last night at all, I kept hearing some weird bumping sounds that made me think someone was walking up and down my stairs but I live alone. Thats so scary, do you believe in ghosts? I do and that's the first thing I thought it could be.",Hope it's a friendly one at least.
I just moved to a new city for work. I do not know anyone that lives here. You should put yourself out there and meet some new people.  Just start exploring the city and you are bound to meet others! You're right I will do that eventually. That is a good way to change my situation rather than sulking around.,It is.  It isn't healthy to be by yourself for too long.  Humans are social creatures!
"This lady at the store was yelling and hitting her toddler the other day when I was shopping. I was appalled at what she did. Wow, no parent should ever abuse their children like that. Did you or anyone do anything? I wanted to, but didn't know what my place would be in that scenario.  It was quite maddening and off putting.  ",Yea I totally understand where you're coming from. Hopefully someone nearby was able to call CPS or law enforcement.
"I ordered pants online that I thought would fit, and they didn't!  Lol, what a bummer. What happened? Apparently my legs grew and I didn't notice! I do workout four days a week.  ","Well there you go, at least you a got a positive out of a negative situation haha!"
I was shocked to see how many hotdogs they were eating at one. This has to be a sin...and a gigantic waste of food. Where did this happen? I think New York? I wasn't there personally but I saw it on TV. It was an eating contest but it was disgusting!,"Oh wow, yeah that sounds gross! I agree with the wasted food too. There are starving people all around the world!"
"MY favorite restaurant was closed today. Oh no, why were they closed? I have no idea. I was really looking forward to a meal from there today. ","Im sorry, I know how much that stinks, like when you really really want Chickfila and its Sunday..."
I am afraid of airplanes. O really? Any specific reason for this fear? I just do not being off the ground.,Flying scares a lot of people but it's safer then driving over all.
Some guy cut me off in traffic the other day and made me spill my coffee.  I was pretty upset. He couldve killed you! I know!  I had to swerve to miss him and ended with coffee on my lap.  Luckily it was pretty cool by that point.,I really hate bad drivers. 
I have been single for a while. I miss having aman around the house. I know that can be hard.  How long has it been since you've been out with someone? 2 years. I thought I missef my ex but wr talk often and I definitely don't want that headache lol ,"Yeah, alot of times you just have to be reminded why you broke up.  I know there is someone out there for you, just stay positive and they will come your way!"
"So, last night, my devious little mutt of a dog Mimi pooped all over the kitchen.  That must of been no fun. It was no fun indeed! I was extremely irked by her behavior - and the fact that I had to clean it up. She usually doesn't act like this.",Hopefully she doesn't do it again.
I do not like ants. I'm not too fond of them myself. Why don't you like them? I hate when they bite me.,"Yeah, especially fire ants. Those are nasty little buggers."
"Man, doesn't it grind your gears when people make actual racist remarks? Yea that is the worst. I don't understand how it can comeout of here mouth Yea, one time I met an Uncle who I hadn't seen since I was a kid. I always thought he was a cool guy, but the dude just spewed racist stuff the whole time. What's worse, is that they were comments about my family. ",I hope you just walked away dude. Nothing good can come of that. I bet you were furious.
"My best friend died last month. Well, that escalated quickly. I'm hoping this is not real? It is real unfortunately.",":( That is messed up, did he/she show any warning signs before their passing? It's not your fault by the way."
I didn't a giant puddle in the aisle and I tripped on it. I was so humiliated... Did you hurt your self? Just a minor bruise on my ankle but my ego was hurt even more as people laughed at me.,That wasn't nice of them.
"I got some bad news yesterday...my grandmother was admitted to the hospital for cancer. Sorry for the bad news. Thanks for the condolences. They are telling me it isn't severe, so I have somewhat high hopes for her eventual recovery.",I know she will make it.
"When I was going out to my car this morning, I was greeted by the disgusting sight of a dead possum. It probably stank a lot too. Oh, you're telling me. It was REVOLTING. I was too afraid to move it, so I had to run it over with my car. Now it's all over my driveway.","You probably should have moved with a shovel of something, instead of running over it"
I am so annoyed at President Trump I am too! I am really not a fan on how he is handling relations with Russia. What makes him annoying to you? You just mentioned.His relations with Putin.There is something fishy about it.,I know right? Doesn't seem right. Especially with the whole Russian interference with the election.
A few years back I got separate from my hunting party. I had to spend the night in the woods by myself. That must of been no fun. It was way too quiet!  You could hear  everything. I hated being out there by myself.,Did you have a flashlight?
I am so mad I couldn't go to Disneyland. Oh no. Ive only been once but it was great. What happened? My flight got canceled and I couldn't get on another flight.,That terrible. Were you able to get a refund?
My daughter is so silly. Sometimes its okay. Sometimes its annoying. How old is she? 13. She is the worst sometimes. ,Why not send her to summer camp?
I can not believe I lied to my mother. What was it about? About why I needed to borrow money.,What did you spend it on?
I finally saw that one scary movie my friends were talking about. I can't sleep without the lights on. What movie was it? The Grudge.,I have never seen it.
I saw the nastiest thing on tv. A guy at a sandwich and it was crawling with spiders. It made me sick. He must of been crazy. Something was definitely wrong with him.,"Yes, id he do it for money?"
"About four years ago, my apartment was robbed. I discovered the state of my apartment. Everything turn over, any object that had some value was taken. I was totaly destroyed. Holy moly, that must've been a very depressing sight. Did the police end up finding the culprit? The police were useless. They came once then I never heard from them again.",I do hope nothing of value was stolen. I would be frantic if someone stole my family heirlooms.
I am about to enter the workforce again soon. Hopefully What job are you going to get? I haven't started looking yet. The kids are all going to be in school now and I can work outside the home though. ,What did you use to do for work?
President Trump annoys me. I think he annoys most people. I just wish he didn't tweet.,His tweets are rude and ill informed and he never apologizes for anything.
"So, last night I was enjoying myself watching a movie. I ordered pizza and it didn't come on time. It was an hour late! I bet you were starving! Did they say why they were so late?  Oh, they said they were over-saturated with orders, but come on! An hour is way too long.",Did you get it free? I would be so annoyed!
"I couldn't find my debit card all week and I've finally given up. I think I have to get it replaced. Aw man, I've been there before. Has anyone tried using it? No, I kept track of the transaction on my mobile app. I'm pretty sure I lost it.",That really sucks. Fortunate to hear that no one misused it though. They are typically pretty fast at sending you a new one.
"My car was broken into last night. I lost my laptop, loose change I had in the cupholders, my GPS, and they yanked my radio set out. Did you call the police? I did but they only took a report and that's about it. This is so upsetting.",They will find who did it.
"I went to the bowling alley yesterday all alone - my friends ditched me. That sucks, did you still have fun? No, not really. I went anyway, because I wanted to have a good time. It was rather lonely.",What did you bowl?
"Hillary Clinton annoys me She annoys me as well! She seemed pretty fraudulent in the last election. Yes, she should be in jail.","Yes, especially for all those emails they found on her private server. Despicable."
"I am sick that I send Obama money for his campaign. Oh man, why are you even still sending him money? This wasn't recent this was 8 years ago.","Ahhh, so you're upset at your past self? We all make mistakes, man, it's good. What we think is good for us sometimes turns out to not be, but hindsight is twenty twenty."
"I went to traffic court the other day and was promised that I would get off with a warning, but I ended up with a $300 fine.  I was so mad! So much for them being up front for you. Man $300 for what thats a lot. It was a ton.  I was going 5 over in a construction zone, but no one was around where I was.  So aggravating! ","Yea construction zones are crazy, so often nooones there!"
"I almost got into a car accident yesterday. Have you ever been in one before? Yes, I hate that so much. The sound of screeching and crushing metal is traumatizing. Even though I didn't hear any of that, I still felt pretty traumatized - my heart was beating so fast. Were you hurt in yours?","Unfortunately, yes. I had to get a few staples in my head but my car was totaled..."
"I wish I could of said goodbye before my friend died. Aw man, that has to be rough. Were you guys really close? Yes we had been friends since birth.",That's even more saddening. Did you get to say somewhat of a goodbye to him at their funeral?
"My dog peed all over the fresh, funky socks that I just purchased. Did you return the socks? No, unfortunately the store wouldn't take them back. As punishment, I am forcing my dog to wear the socks. ",That is mean.
"I wish I had kept my Maxima instead of buying an SUV. I like driving closer to the ground. Can you trade in the SUV? I could sure but I will be starting over on payments, I might look into it. Then why would you buy can SUV?","At the time it was a change and I like the ride of it, but I did not realize I would miss the sedan as much as I did."
"I am so scared of waterbugs. What do you have against the ole waterbug? They are bugs, huge, and they fly. One crawled over my foot at my grandmas house over the weekend. ",That is terrifying indeed! I hoped you swatted that beast with the biggest fly swatter available.
"Tomorrow is a fine day for me - I start my new job. Congratulations. Are you excited? I'm quite anxious, to be honest. Completely new experience, completely new people. Hopefully I'll fit in.",You'll do fine. I look at new things as adventures. 
"No one showed up for my birthday party. I was so alone and sad. That would be depressing, did you plan it yourself or did someone plan it for you? Well, both sort of. I expected at least one person, ya know? Not a single soul to be found.","Maybe if you post to social media, a bunch of random strangers will show up."
"My son failed his physics exam yesterday.  Ouch, was it an unfair test or did he not study? Naw, he's somewhat lazy like myself when I was a young lad, but still, it was rather disappointing.","Yea, hope he can make it up the rest of the year."
"Last night was trash night and I forgot to take out the rank kitchen trash. Ewww, throw that away ASAP. Well, I would love to, but I lost my can last night in the storm. I feel so bad, because my wife can't stand the smell.",Throw it in your neighbor's trash can. I'm sure they would understand?
"Today, I ran over some roadkill on my way home from work. It was rather disgusting. Oh no! What was it? It was a dead possum. It was in one piece before I ran it over...but I didn't see anything behind me when I passed it. My tires must've grinded that poor little guy into smithereens. ",Yikes! I hope you didn't have any car damage.
"oh man I fell down a flight of stairs at the LSU game last weekend. I was mortified because everyone laughed. I hate it when people laugh at me, it's so humiliating! Its the worst. I didn't want to come out of the bathroom afterwards.","Oh god, that's the worst part. The shame afterwards...."
I haven't even started my new diet. What diet do you want to do? It's something a family told me about. Small portions of healthy food and exercise. ,Make sure you drink water also.
I miss my father so much What happened to him? He died a year ago and I still miss him.We were really closed.,So sorry to hear that.  I hope that the pain fades with time.
"I had been hoping and praying to get my teeth fixed for as long as I can remember. I thought I had saved up enough money but it turns out it's going to cost way more than I had hoped. Oh what a disapointment, well you can keep saving, does it hurts too much? That's where I am fortunate, I'm in no pain. It's more cosmetic than anything else so I guess I shouldn't be so disappointed over it. ","Oh ok i get it, well you just will have to save longer, thanks God its painless!"
"My dog died last week. I've been so depressed without her. I am sorry to hear that. Thank you, she was pretty old so our family sort of expected it but she left so quick. ",I hope you had fun with her.

I kept raising my hand in class in my lecture the other day and the teacher wouldn't pick on me. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe it was because I usually answer all the question. I felt quite peeved.,"Oh, then don't feel bad? I think the teacher is trying to get everyone else involved."
It makes me depressed seeing homeless people. I wish I could help them but I am going through tough times too. You can always give them some money once you get yourself back on your feet.

I picked up this aardvark on the black market. Named him Arthur. He pooped all over my carpet yesterday. What is a aardvark? It's an exotic animal that lives in the rain forests of South America.

"Before I met my girlfriend and friends I was very lonely, that was not a fun time That makes me sad to hear.  Do you have lot's of friends now? Not a lot but I have a good group of a few friends, so that is nice",I think it is better to a few really good friends than a lot of acquaintances.

My supervisor belittled me in front of all of my coworkers in a meeting. That is absolutely horrible! Was this recent? Yes it was. I was furious and hurt. Leaders should not do that to their employees.,I agree. You should bring that up to HR. 
My daughter was sick the other day and I couldn't afford to miss work.  That's an unfortunate predicament to be in.  What did you end up doing? I sent her to daycare even though I probably shouldn't have. I would get fired if I stayed home though.,"That's a tough decision for sure, but you definitely can't get fired for something like that, and kids are exposed to germs all the time."
"Back then I was a big chicken and couldn't approach women, let alone get numbers.

Yup sweatin bullets haha","She scared me too, I hope you're not scarred for life!"
I found some pictures of me when I was a teenager with some of my friends at a party and sat for ages going through them I know that feeling.

"I was at the grocery store yesterday and did something I am not proud of. The cashier gave me too much money back and when I realized it I didn't say anything and kept it. Did you need the money for something specific?  No, I think I was just being greedy.  I should not have done it.",Were you able to sleep last night?
"I was out shopping the other day and I tripped on my shoe laces. Did you get hurt? No, just my feelings.",Glad to hear that.

"hey man, I feel so ashamed lately I am sorry to hear that. Can I ask why? well the thing is I am not doing so well, and my mom is helping me financially. She has the means to do so but I am just very ashamed about it you know",I don't think you should feel ashamed at all. Parent's are there to help you until you are able to manage on your own.

"A couple years ago, my friend died from an overdose. We were not super close but it was fun hanging out and I felt very shocked when I heard the news. That is really sad. Many people I grew up with have passed from overdose. It's tragic. I agree, I thought the war on drugs was meant to combat or maybe even make ground against this. I don't think it is working. ",I don't believe it is either. I'm so sorry to hear about your friend.

"I never finished school. I had problems with my mental health and just stopped showing up to class. It was very hard for me. Oh no, are you feeling any better now? Or are you still having problems? Well this was four years ago. I am barely starting to feel better now, I am in the beginning steps of going to vocational school","Oh, well that sounds like a step in the right direction at least. I hear vocational school is great for many different kind of jobs, usually more physical."

"The other day I was at work and my friend wouldn't help do any of the work! the entire day she just sat there and talked, I was so mad at her.

I was on the phone with my bank about some overdraft charges that were charged because of their error. I am still angry about it. That's horrible! I hope it wasn't a lot of money! It was about $350 in fees.  I was able to get them all reversed but it took about a month.  So irritating!,That's happened to me before. I hate trying to get things like that settled.
"My sister is so lucky adn sso good at design, she has the prettiest nursery set up for her daughter!  My kids were lucky to have a matching crib bed set lol That's cool! It's nice to have someone close that is talented like that and can help with those things. Yes, she's just so naturally good at it.  I'm not crafty but she is. Always has been.  Her daughter is going to have a gorgeous room as long as she's under her roof ","I always wish I was good at design. I've tried, but I'm pretty garbage, haha!"
"I am irritated at people who smoke near me at work.

I just replaced my headlights in my truck and one of them went out inside of a week. That's very irritating! Is it difficult to change the headlights in your truck? It's not but its a pain in the neck and $35  Yeah that shouldn't happen. I hate changing the headlights on my car. They made it really tough to get to. That's the nice part about a truck. Plenty of room. Terrible gas mileage.,"I can see the appeal. I have the opposite situation. Tiny sub-compact, but goes a long time on a tank."
I am very anxious about the country these days Why are you anxious about the counry? Because of the tarif war president Trump declare to the world.,"I think we'll be fine.   Peopel talk a lot about a trade war but, leave out the fact that places like the EU already tax our goods at much higher rates than we tax theirs.

My wife left me a month ago.My friends are trying to help me,but it's not working","Aw man, Im sorry. That sounds rough. I know how you feel. Time usually helps but it's pretty gradual. Hang in there."
"I can't believe the state of our politics in America. Can we use the ""broken"" to describe our political system?  Absolutely.

I bet it was.It looks like you had a panic attack. Yeah, it was humiliating.  They were just sitting the staring at me.  The silence was brutal!",You probably need to do some kind of therapy to supres these panic attacks.
When my friend comes over he never keeps an eye on his kids and they ravage my home! That is horrible! Have you ever said anything to him about it? I don't know how to bring it up. I always hope he'd catch subtle hints like when I ask his kids to please not climb on my stuff!,"Maybe you should mention that you just want a ""guy's night"" and he would get the hint? "
"I forgot to pack my suit so I had to borrow my friend's extra one when attending a wedding, and man it fits so bad! I look terrible! That sucks. Well on the bright side at least you had a suit.

I am feeling an intense fear these days. first way to overcome it is to figure out the reason for the fear I know the reason. I found a mole on my back and I am afraid it's cancer,I think you have to go for a check up first before you can conclude. It might be a harmless mole
"I recently went to a safari where I was riding in a vehicle and one of the elephants got a bit rowdy and pushed up against the truck. I was freaking out! Oh wow! That must have been frightening!

"My social anxiety kicked up the other day while paying for groceries and I failed at doing basic math in my hand due to my nerves. I ended up giving the wrong amount of money. It's okay.

When my anxiety acts up, it's like my brain just goes blank.",We all have those moments! Sometimes you just have to shake it out of your mind and take a deep breath.
"I cheated on my diet today.  That's not so bad. Everyone cheats on their diet from time to time. I would just pick up where you left off. True, but I haven't cheated on my diet in over a year.

"My husband was out of town for work recently, and it made me bummed out. I had no one to talk to or spend time with.  That sucks.

",That's understandable. I'd probably feel the same way in the same situation.
"I invested some of my money in the crypto market last year. The market looks terrible right now and I'm afraid I'll lose my money! Oh that's awful! I invested 6,000 in January and I'm down to $150 now. I sold off a lot to pay bills but if I wait for it to go back up I can maybe recover 1,500.  Holy moly, that's a pretty big loss! I guess all we can do is wait and see.","I know, I am confident it will go back so I'm hanging on to this last bit. Good luck!"
"My dad didn't invite me to his wedding, talk about an all time low. So you guys probably don't get along very well? We haven't talked in awhile but I think that's because of his soon to be wife. I've never felt so alone without my family.",Does the wife hate you?
"My fiance found a snake in our yard the other day! It was terrifying! Wow, that is scary. Did you guys do anything or just stay away from it? No he killed it.

I'm glad your fiance got it before it caused anyone anymore trouble."

You want to have the moral high ground.  But yes I would confront him

Yeah, it was when I was gathering up my trash when I was wrapping up my lunch, so it was an honest mistake. I felt pretty awful about it.","I'm sure if you explain it to them, and maybe treat them to lunch another day, they'll forgive you, if they haven't already."
"I have the worst headache and can't get any of my cleaning done. It's frustrating. Have you tried taking any aspirin? I feel bad for you, my friend. I did but it's not doing the trick.

I am glad to hear that she is feeling better,"

"I got off work the other day and noticed one of my tires had been slashed in the parking lot.  Needless to say, not the best way to end the work day Holy moly, that's some rough luck.

Is your insurance company covering it at least?
"I have a huge test tomorrow in Physics and I don't feel prepared for it. Get to studying! I'm sure if you get in a few mores hours you will feel more confident!  You're right! But no matter how much studying I may do, I know it's going to be a tough one.",Hard work always pays off!
"So, yesterday morning, some ingrate stole my cappuccino at Starbucks. How did that happen? I would be so upset. Well, it was pretty busy, so I think he just thought it was his. Maybe we had the same name? Anywho, all I know is is that I was far grumpier than usual.",Did Starbucks not make you a new one? I am definitely grumpy if I don't get my morning coffee! 
"Way back in my elementary school days, I lost the spelling when I was only in the second grade. Oh well it's still fun that you got to participate in that.

Did he ever apologize to you and give the money back?
"I told my son repeatedly to do the dishes, but instead he played video games all night and never got them done. You should confiscate his video game and teach him a lesson.

I hope it's never gonna happen to you again."
I had a huge conflict with my parents about moving to another country and I was simply enraged to have them trying to control my life. That's a bummer. What happened once you moved there?

I hope I can have a similar once someday.
"I can't stop spending money, no matter what I do, no matter how many budgets I put together. How can I be so careless? That would be tough! Have you tried switching to cash envelopes?

Most of my co-workers are incompetent and can't recognize basic patterns it sucks when you can't depend on co-workers Yeah ,well i hope some better people get hired
"I ate all of the pizza that I got my friends last night. I felt pretty rotten afterwards. Oh wow, I have done that before as well. You may have to deal with some indigestion.

I was doing some shopping in a thrift store recently and came across a toy similar to one I had when I was a kid. It really made me remember my childhood. Maybe you should buy it for keep sake  I thought about it but I'd really have no use for it now.,"oh ok, I understand"
I caught my wife red handed cheating on me I feel so bad Oh that's got to be very tough! I'm sorry to hear that. How did you respond? I couldn't move my body.

I had a friend who was really driving me crazy last night. He was constantly calling me trying to get me to help with a project that he's working on. Unfortunatley I really don't know anything about his project so anything I could do was very limitied. He should be understanding of that and not keep on. That's just frustrating for everyone involved I wish he was more understanding. But sometimes he seems to miss some obvious facts.,Sounds very immature if you ask me
"Someone crashed into my parked car yesterday. Omg!, does the place have camera? at least so that the police can track down the person hopefully, i was so mad.",If you have insurance I think you will be fine

Most likely he will study finance. His grades are good but not the best, so we just don't know what to expect.  ",Well I wish luck to both of you.
My coworker was given a great work assignment this morning. It seems like she did nothing to even deserve it. I wish I could get such great assignments! I hate when that happens.  Things always seem to go that way. I know it's really frustrating. I don't know what I should do at all.,All you can do is just keep doing the best job you can and hopefully someone will notice someday.
I love by myself and it gets so boring.  Its just me and my dog. Your dog doesn't keep you good company? And that should have said LIVE lol.  She does.. but its not the same as having other people to talk to.,I guess so but it should be able to alleviate a lot of that loneliness.
"My son is getting ready to go off to college and I find myself so happy and sad at the same time. I'm just remembering all the wonderful times we had with him growing up. It went so quickly! Well you knew that you would have to let go one day, didn't you? Yes, I have always known that, and I know it's a great thing. But it's hard not to feel emotional about it. Life is about to really change.","We have only one option when it comes to change, embrace it!"

Yesterday I walked through the park to get some fresh air. I saw a mother beating up her kid in the park. I can't believe that some people really will do that. That sounds aggravating.

Im not sure my boyfriend is the one Oh no! That is a hard thing to think about. You might want to take some time apart and find it out to be fair to him I think so too. He is so sweet too. ,Well think about what qualities he has- There are so many dishonest people out there and abusive people. Sometimes we don't connect with someone good..but will regret it later.

Mistakes were made.","I'm no doctor, but it sounds like you might need even more to balance things out."
My ex flaked on me again today. That sucks. Why did he/she do that? He sucks. He was supposed to pick up our son today.

I used to do that but with coins and stuff. I miss being a little ruthless, careless kid! Well she looked up and was counting the floors. I ran inside terrified and felt so bad.",I bet she was so confused lol
"I was offered a higher paying position at my job, but I'm not sure if I'll accept it due to the added stress. If I were you I would accept it because no amount of stress could stop me from making more money. I don't know. I believe we only get one life, and I'd rather spend my time enjoying life rather than working it away.",If you accept it you can enjoy taking a nice vacation that you otherwise wouldn't be able to afford.
"I bought new flavor of coffee today from Starbucks. I was so shocked at how bad it was. I'm never going to try a new coffee flavor. Oh, that's never fun. You think you're going to discover a new favorite and then....blech! Exactly. That's why I'm going back to my old ways so I don't get disappointed like that.",The old ways are the best ways sometimes. 
"Hi, Are you afraid of the snakes? Yes I am terrified!  We have venemous ones in my backyard - water moccs! That's a big problem. I almost stepped on one like 30 minutes ago!",Oh my!  That's so scary!  Glad you're ok!!
"There was a guy I liked and my friend knew it but she set him up with our other friend instead! What a mean friend person. Did you get mad? I was really upset especially since they are seriously dating now and I have to see them everywhere! That could have been you.. yes, true, but there's probably someone out there better than him!",Maybe..
"I lost a couple of loved ones last year and I can't get it off my mind.  Have you thought about speaking with a counselor? I don't think it's at that point yet, but it has been making me feel down pretty often. Mostly at night when trying to sleep.","Well, you should know that your feelings are a normal thing to happen in this event."
"Do you like to drink the coffee drinks? I love coffee, actually. I drink a few cups every morning! You would have been mad at me this morning! ","Oh yeah, why's that? Don't tell me you spilled some delicious coffee!"
It was such a relief that I knew the work they were doing in school. What type of work are they doing at school? It was calculus and i hadn't done it in 2 years.,"Ah, I see. Well, it's been a lot longer since I did calculus. Good on you, remembering that stuff!"
"I got my results back from my doctor and I am so scared. I think I might have cancer... Oh my god, I am so sorry to hear that! I am terrified at the moment. I don't know how much longer I have to live.",Please try to stay positive. Having a positive attitude can do great things for recovery! Many people have survived cancer!
"This morning I ran over my neighbors mail box. When getting home later that afternoon I noticed it was back up. I hope he doesn't know it was me! Oops. Well it happens. You better hope they don't have a camera haha. That's the first thing I thought of! I don't remember ever seeing a camera there. I do feel pretty terrible, though.",Don't worry. They will probably run over your mailbox one day and hope you don't have a camera.
I forgot the make my credit card payment yesterday. I feel so bad because I told myself all day yesterday not to forget. Was the due date yesterday?  Is the payment late now?   I think so. I am feel so guilty because the interest was so avoidable. I forget so many things all the time... ,"Sometimes there is actually a grace period after the due date.  I've paid bills a couple of days late without a fee (not sure about credit card interest, though)."
"Sooo scary! I was in the basement today and I swear to you I saw a ghost Ghost are not scary, they are us without our physical bodies.  I know but I wasn't expecting it.. and it looked like my mom. ",You should have talked to your mom.
"I got on a roller coaster yesterday and I ended up puking everywhere! I just wanted to disappear! Lol, I bet you were disgusted with yourself I definitely was! I felt so shame that I couldn't look anyone in the eyes for the rest of the day.","Aw, don't take it too serious though. Everyone pukes in public at least once in their life!"
I am angry  with my mother for not telling me who my father is Did you find out who your father is yet? Yes I knew from my mother's best friend,Did you dad and the other lady have a thing?
I just heard there was an earthquake in Indonesia. Really? Any idea how strong it was? Any casualties? It was really strong I think many people died. ,That's awful. I feel bad for people that have to live in areas prone to natural disasters like that.
"My boss screwed up on his work and told HIS boss that it as me! Argh! That is the worst. I am so sorry. Is it enough to inspire you to look for work elsewhere? It definitely is. I would have preferred to get him fired, but I have no evidence of his screw up to show!","If he's done that to you, he's doing it to others -- that kind of behavior isn't sustainable. Others are *bound* to notice at some point -- but I know waiting for that is frustrating!"
"Ok.. So I will admit it. I pee'd my pants the other day. At work. Oh dear. Well, that does happen. Did you have any other clothes to change into? No.. I had to sneak out and hope no one saw me.  LOL.  I think I was successful because I haven't heard anything bout it yet.","If your workplace is anything like mine, you'd have heard plenty by now. I've done something similar, but could call my husband to sneak in some clean clothes - they are useful now and again!"
Yesterday I bought a croissant inn the bakery and when I paid they gave me the wrong change. Wow thats annoying.  but I hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back Not the worst part is that cashier insisted I had given her $10 when I was sure it was $20. Wow thats annoying.  but I hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back I had to speak to the manger to get my money back. ,You should call and ask to speak to the manager.  Maybe they will give you something to make up for it
"I have been feeling so alone lately :( Why is that so? my wife works night shifts as a nurse so i am often home by myself Maybe you could work night shift too and that way you will be able to spend more time together. Oh thats a good idea, I never thought of that",You could also got out foe a while and do something fun.
I think I was tired because I was up all night studying. I guess I was very clumsy that day.  What happened from your clumsiness? I ended up dropping my lunch tray in front of a girl I was attracted to!,I remember when that happened on the Spiderman movie. Did she laugh at you?
"Today was my one day to sleep in, and I got woken up early by the construction workers making noise early this morning Gee, that's no fun. I hope it wasn't too early? There are usually laws about making noise early in the morning. They started hammering away at 7am.  I think I am going to call their boss and complain.  Maybe ill call him tomorrow at 7am","Yes, that's a good idea. I think 7am is way too early for that."
Ugghhh!  My neighbor's dog has gone to the bathroom in my yard again!! I have four dogs.  I am probably guilty of this crime.  I would just throw it back over. I usually leave it on their front door step.  lol.,One time this lady 1 house away scooped up all the cat poo from my cat under her window into a bag and put it on my front door with a note.  I thought... why did she clean it up for me?  Wouldn't it have been more affective to ask me to clean it up?  
"Always embarrassing to fall off my dirtbike! Oh no! did you hurt yourself? I did, had so many cuts on my leg. Mom had to bandage me up. How did the dirtbike hold up? And how old are you?! It was fine, just my leg was all mangled. The cop drove me home thankfully. Oh dear, sounds like a serious accident. I'm glad you are okay! Could have been terrible.  Very thankful that it wasn't worse.",I'm glad you're okay- that must have been scary. 
"I need some advice on if I should say something Yeah? I'd be happy to help. But say something about what exactly? I went to the store the other day and when they were ringing me up, some of my stuff didn’t scan, so I got $20 worth for free.","Hm.. yeah that is a dilemma. I mean if you can afford it, the honest thing would be to go and offer the manager to pay it back."
"On my way to work today, some guy just cut me off in his car. Can you believe that? Wow, some people are horrible drivers.  Did you honk at him? Yes I did, I let him know he needed to at least use his indicators. He didn't even signal!",At least you didn't get into an accident.  I guess it could have been a lot worse.
"We had a departmental meeting at work recently that made me feel really anxious.  We're trying to figure out who our new department head should be. I think you will be fine. Don't feel too anxious worrying won't do anything One of the candidates is someone who makes a bunch of us miserable, so we're worried they will get the job.",prayer works for me. I hope it does for you too so that person you just talked about won't get the job
"I have a crush on this person, and I dont know if they like me, and I don't want to ask and be rejected. Yeah it's probably for the best. You don't want to risk rejection. Maybe they will approach you. I can only hope.. hope and hope.. such is the life of a hoper..",Well there is no 'I' in hope. It is a something we all have to do at some point in life.
"Love isn’t fair sometimes.  You know what I mean? Oh, I know for sure. There are no rules to follow.  This girl at work and I have perfect chemistry and we always seem to hit it off.  Well I just found out that she has a boyfriend.  So not fair.  ",Ugh. Maybe you can wait out that relationshio.
I lost my favorite shoe today! Oh no! How did that happen?  I don't know. But now I am upset because I wasn't able to make it to my favorite gym!,"Gee, I hope you can find it. Maybe retract where you have been recently and you will find it!"
"I baked a batch of cookies for my kid's birthday party. The only problem was I couldn't resist eating a few before the party. They were so good. What kind of cookies did you bake? They were chocolate chip, my favorite. Well before I realized it I had eaten every cookie. I felt so bad that the guests would not get any!",I would totally have some if you let me. I love chocolate chip!
"I can't believe they cut me from that team. What What???  What team?  Who cut you? The local baseball team, I did my tryouts and it didn't go well! I love baseball.  The have better snacks than every other sport. Agreed the hot dogs are delicious. I am sorry bout you being cut though.  Keep on training.. I will do my best and for sure will.",We get old.. we get injured.. we eat hotdogs.
I had booked a trip to Paris for me and my spouse but she fell and broke her leg about 6 weeks before we were supposed to go. We had to postpone for 6 months.  Did you guys get to go? Is the leg all fixed now? We did go. It was for my 40th birthday a few years ago.  ,Are you planning a new trip for your upcoming birthday?
"ok, don’t judge me, but this is going to sound silly but i cried watching a movie the other day There is nothing silly about that.  Movies are meant to illicit emotion.  You feel better now though, right? Yes, yes I do. It was The Notebook.  I just got really emotional watching it.",Definitely don't feel bad then.  I think everyone cried during that movie!
I just found out that my cousin passed away after his battle with colon cancer. He was only 27. I am so upset! ,I am not sure how to deal with the loss!
"My coworker just got selected to enroll in a leadership class offered by my work. I also applied but didn't get selected. I really wish I was in his shoes righyt now! Yeah that's too bad, sorry to hear that. Do you know why you didn't get picked? I'm not sure.  I thought I was more qualified than him.  It seems like I can never get what other have.",Keep your head up. Maybe you'll get picked the next time around.
"My 11 year old cat died this morning... Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did he die of old age? Yes I think so, he was all grey and stuff. Had arthritis too.","Well, hopefully he lived a good and happy life.  "
"Hey this guy who lives with me wasn't doing his scheduled work, and I had to talk to him about it..  Sometimes you have to put people in their place. Yeah, he was being really uncooperative and seemed to not care about other people's time. ",Well I hope he learned his lesson. We don't play those games where i'm from.
"I was so aggravated today while I was installing a new light fixture in my dining room!! Oh no! Did you eventually get it working after the frustration? I did, but something shorted out and blew out my dimmer switch. I had to make another trip to Home Depot to fix it.","That's frustrating, nothing ever seems to go right the first time you try it! Glad you got it working finally!"
"I didn't have enough money to pay my rent this month so I took the money from the cash at work. I feel terrible. Dang, maybe you should have bought a lottery ticket instead? yeah, well I couldn't risk loosing any more money. I don't know what to do.",Maybe you can find a cheaper place to live?
Last week I cleaned my house when my kids were off at summer camp. I was so glad I got it done. That is so satisfying. I hope they don't mess it up now that they are home! Funny you say that. I had to run an errand last night and when I came home it was even messier than before. I nearly lost it!,NOOOOOOOO!!!! Bad kids! That must have been infuriating. 
"I remember one time when I was little I was running around in the basement when I wasn't supposed to be. Gee that sounds fun, but did you get in trouble? Yeah, my mom had told me multiple time to not run in the basement. Next thing I know, I tripped on a lamp cord making the lamp fall and break into pieces. ",Oh no! That's no fun. I hope they're not still mad at you!
"I saw the new Jurassic Park movie the other day. It was such a let down for me. i remember being a kid when the first one came out Same here!  It is one of my favorite movies!  For some reason, the new one just falls flat for me.  I expected so much more.",i think the franchise has just started trying too hard.
When I cross a major street I am always worry about getting hit by a car. I try to be careful and only cross at the crosswalk but I am still nervous. Those are good preventative measures. I assume that you always look both ways as well? Yes I look both ways and never use my cell phone in the intersection. Sometimes I wish I wasn't soch a worry-wort.,There are worse things to be worried about. Good job on you for taking safety seriously!
" I lent my friend 500$ and she never paid me back. Ugh. I am too nice sometimes. Wow, that sucks. Do you know if she will eventually? Can you trust her? I think she will.  I hope she will.  I feel betrayed. ",Yeah I would too. I hope you get the money back!
"I was feeling hungry a little while ago until I thought back on that time I ordered a submarine sandwich and had the grossest experience. What was the gross part about the sandwich? I took three bites into the sandwich, and about half way as I pulled back from the sandwich was a hair connected from my mouth being pulled out of the food. I've never experienced something like that from fast food. ",Yes that is a nasty thing to experience. But at least you were able to extract the hair!
i was trimming dead leaves off of my tomato plants and ended up getting swarmed by mosquitos. That really stinks. I bet you will wear bug spray next time! bug spray doesn't do anything for me. ,Well then maybe you should get some bats. They love to eat mosquitos!
"I don't know what to do. I played a game of poker with some sketchy guys and now I owe them a lot of money. Oh, jeez! That's terrifying. Can you get a loan from someone to pay them? I don't think so. I have bad credit. They drive by my house late at night, I don't know what to do.",Call the police! Or move. 
"Hi, have you ever eaten a sandwich with hard bread? I like a good hard bread like Pumpernickel. Do you know what that word means? No, what does it mean?","It means the devil's fart, haha! Good bread though."
"I am a little scared. I found out my neighbor is a satan worshiper. Whoa, that's extreme. Can you say some prayers for them?  Well I am not christian, and in a way.. who am I to knock someone else for theirs",Yes good point. Maybe try and understand why they believe in the things they do?
"My girlfriend has a new yoga instructor names Mark. He is such good shape, I feel a bit weird about her going to his classes. Don't worry bout that.  She has to have some sort of fantasy in her life.  Don't you have any ever? Well yes, my instructor Marissa is so dreamy. But still... I see the way she looks at Mark.",Well know that it isn't any different from you checking out other girls too.
I had a test today and was very nervous about it. how did it go? It was fine and now I will be able to graduate!,congrats! that is amazing news.
i really miss my family. we are 800 miles away from each other. Did you make any plans to go and visit them? i try to go once a year but money is tight right now. ,Maybe you will be able to make some extra money!
I bought a lottery ticket a few days ago. I felt so confident it was going to win the jackpot! well did you ? the most i ever won was like 20 bux lol Unfortunately I didn't win anything. I was crushed because my expectations were so high!,"well im confident one day you will win in life something great in life , better than money "
I am waiting for this storm to approach Is there any warnings? How much rain are you expecting? I don't watch the tv. I can hear it sounds pretty bad though and I forecast that it could become a tornado!,That is very scary. We have had a lot of rain here and when that happens large trees often come down.
Yesterday my hamster passed away. He was barely two years old :(. What was your hamster's name? His name was Sparky. I reached into his cage to pick him up because he was not moving. His poor body was cold. I was so tearful.,Do you know what it was that happened to kill him?
"The storm is coming, I can hear it with my ears! Oh no, I hope you are ready for it? I am not. No storm shelter or saved up food. I hope I won't be washed away!","Yeah, I hope you won't either. Maybe find a local shelter?"
I got so irritated when I was driving the other day! I hope nobody was trying to cut you off. I got pulled over and I was given a speeding ticket for going 55 in a 50MPH zone.,"Oh God, that must have been aggravating. Hopefully you can get it dismissed."
"I went to a new restaurant last friday and they asked what sauce i would like my food to be cooked with , i said give me the spice dragon thinking it was gonna be hot , it was sweet and tangy i only ate a bit and left the rest there Oh wow, that's disappointing!  it really was , i really dont like sweet food at all, i cant even stand candy",I'm really sorry to hear that! 
I miss when I was a child. I didn't have to do anything besides school and play with my friends. yes those were the days. Now I have to work and pay bills. Responsibility is overrated. I will take childhood any day!,Exactly! If only we could go back.
"I was driving along and had a car accident today.. That's not good, are you ok? Yes I am fine. And noone else was hurt. But my beautiful new car.. ","Hey, hope oyu can get the money back from insurance and they don't charge you a ton more."
I have a new storm shelter and food. But I didn't get anything to play with for the storm. You need something to pass the time or you will go crazy with boredom. How about some books or cards? Yes that is a great one. I will put your ideas onto my list. I will be better prepared for the next storm! ,If you have someone with you cards are great. Good luck in your next storm!
"I just got home from work and I cannot even begin to tell you how mad I am right now! What a day, huh?! Can you tell me what happened or is it still too raw? Well, my dog decided it would be a good day to eat my shoes and then take a poop on my floor, so i had to scrub the floor clean.","That is not something I would want to come home to seeing. And your day at work was bad too, wow!"
"I feel so alone! I'm a single mom and my son just went off to college. Aww, that's a bummer. Well at least you can look forward to his visits. Yes, that's true! He promised he'd come home often to visit!","Depending how far away he is, he probably will! Just make sure to spoil him when he does lol!"
I have been looking for a mate for such a long time. I want to find a single mother with an empty nest. Sometimes it's hard to find that certain someone! Have you tried a dating app? It sure is tough. Every time I find someone online it turns out there is something weird about them. I guess I will be lonely for the rest of my life.,Keep your chin up! That special person will come along when you're least expecting it!
I just made a new friend. really? How did you meet them? I met them at the store. But there is more.. ,I hope they aren't like a crazy stalker or anything.  Be careful!

I will mourn him every day and reminisce about the good times we had.",Well I'm glad you have good memories to remember him by.
I was eating at my favorite Chinese restaurant recently. During one bite I felt a crunch in my mouth. That's gross. What was it?? I looked down and realized I had bitten into a cockroach. I was appalled but finished the food anyway. Guess I got my protein for the day.,I would have thrown up! Did you tell the manager?
I'm having to cancel my Labor Day plans since I have to work.  My boss is taking a trip and we both can't be gone from work.  I'm disappointed.   That stinks!  What were your plans? I was going to Georgia to watch my cousin's son play in his first college football game.  It was going to be a nice family reunion type trip. ,I'm so sorry you had to change your plans!  Perhaps you can schedule some time after Labor Day to come and see him play?
I was so ashamed of my self the other day! I went to work with two different shoes! What was the reason that happen to you? I guess I just didn't realize one was blue and one was black and I didn't have time to go home and change! I had to hide my feet all day!,I hope you you work behind a desk. That is the only way you can hide them!!!
"My friend wrecked my car when I let him borrow it over the weekend That is a real bummer. I hope your friend gets it repaired for you. Well, it's a giant hassle to manage from the insurance side but apparently they will cover it if he doesn't. Might hike my rates, though",Well you probably won't be lending your car again any time soon hahah!
"it really annoys me at work that i work so hard , and then slackers get paid the same amount kinda makes me feel invious, like they just get to walk around and get payed for it I totally know the feeling! Have you tried bringing this up to your supervisor? yes i have many times, but they do nothing about it sometimes it just makes want to quit so they are stuck with all the bad workers ","Ha, that would be some pretty good revenge. Maybe you should go ahead and find a new job where you will be appreciated."
"I stepped in some dog poop walking in my neighborhood the other day. That's disgusting, I would have a very hard time finishing that walk. Did you go straight home? Yes I was wearing sandals so I went home to wash it off ASAP.","Oh my gosh, that makes it so much worse! I have done that before too, so I hope that neither one of us has that happen again!!"
"I have to tell you about one of the scariest moments ive had in a long time.. What happened? I went to take my dog outside to use the bathroom last night, and when we walked outside onto the porch there was a giant spider the size of my fist.  I thought it was going to attack me.  I ran back inside so fast.","OMG, those things make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Hopefully it didn't get into your house."
"When we went on vacation last year, I rode tower of terror. I screamed my head off the entire time. That's at MGM right?  My daughter rode that with her daddy when she was 8, she was terrified!  Did you do it again, or was once enough? Yes, it sure is! No, I will never ride that again. It had way too many drops.",That is what I hate about any amusement park ride - the drops!
"I moved out of my dad's house when I was 19 and moved to Atlanta.   That's pretty impressive! Was it scary to move away from home at such a young age? It was - even though the company I worked for moved us all down here, it was still very hard to adjust.  I mean, being in a big city and not having family around was hard.","I'll bet it was! I don't have family around, so I know how lonely that can feel!"
"I work in a position with a few other coworkers in the same position. One, who does little work, recently got a promotion. He was even there less time than me. That would drive me crazy.  How are you handling it? It seems like I just need to find a new place to work. That just isn't fair, but at the same time maybe there's something I'm not seeing.",You can't let it get you too down.  There are some places that just promote people for reasons not related to job performance.
Our daughters are growing up so fast on us. They are now 18 and almost 16.  I think you blink and the years just fly by. Yes i agree.  I have 3 boys and they are in their twenties. I don't know where the years went. I'm slowly learning that life is all about changing and it's changing more rapidly than I'd like.  I catch myself on a daily basis remembering things that have already gone on by.,That's so true! I have a theory that time is just a way to keep everything from happening at once. 
"I wish that when people say they are going to do something or make a promise, that they would stick to it. I know exactly what you mean. I have been let down many times, and it's never a good feeling. I  had plans to go out with my friends tonight, but suddenly everyone is busy now. and Im stuck home alone",You can and should make the best of it. You should have a blast and binge watch some TV show!
I waited for two weeks for my final grades. It seemed to take forever to get them. I couldn't stand it. I bet you were a nervous wreck. I hope they turned out well. It was worth the wait. I ended with a 3.8 gpa.,That's pretty good!  That should qualify for you to graduate with honors.
"My step father passed away last year and my mother moved in with my sister.  She didn't raise me, so it works out that she's living with my sister. Do she at least try to keep in contact with you? A little bit bu, they took the insurance money and bought a big house - i mean BIG! I know they needed more room for my mother to move in, but what they bought was way over and above what was needed.",That's crazy. They shouldn't of taken advantage of your step father like that.
i walked into a church one day and there was a private baptism going on. i was so ashamed.  Oh no. Was there no sign posted or anything? no. the door was unlocked so i thought it was safe to go in. boy was i wrong. ,Well I am sure they won't hold it against you. Honest mistake.
My dog decided to pee on my bed when I wasn't home. Little jerk. Oh no!  And that is hard to get out!  Do you have a waterproof cover on the bed by any chance? Nope. I only discovered it when I tried to lay down on it too. So gross.,"oh YUCK!  Well, I'd suggest a waterproof mattress cover just in case it happens again.  At least if it does happen again, it won't get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes.  I'm so sorry you discovered it that way!"
"The other day I found an iguana in my backyard.... I hate iguanas! it was horrinle Oh no! I think they're cute but I'd probably be freaked out if I saw one in my yard, too. What did you do? I had my husband move it away from being so close to our door... I don't like reptiles but i didnt want to throw out into the street either","Awww well that was nice of you, a lesser person might have stomped it or hurt it."
"I am blushing so bad right now, sometimes technology is not my friend. I can relate.  Sometimes I have issues with new tech.  What is giving you problems? I was texting and flirting with this girl and then a female coworker messaged me about work, and not seeing who i was responding to, I typed a message that was not meant for her. ",Ouch.  That is awkward.  I imagine you can just explain to her that the message was sent to her by mistake.  It happens.
my dog got loose and got in a fight with another dog.  Oh that really stinks. Were either of them injured? the other dog started the fight and my dog got nicked on his snout and tongue. ,Well at least it was nothing serious. Hope they don't fight any more.
"I came home from work to discover that my cat had knocked down the TV Oh no!  Cats can be devious things when we are not home - and sometimes when we are.  Did it break the TV? Yes, yes he did. And of course he didn't care. He was taking a nap next to it when I got back","Aren't they just the most cute, and insanely calculating animals!  "
I don't like being in the woods at night. The coyotes make scary noises. Oh definitely! They almost sound like crying humans sometimes. So you don't like camping? Not really. Unless we are in an RV.,"I totally understand, it can be scary if you don't like all the unknown noises."
"I had to get my foot checked out at the doctor recently. ooooh what happened , are you ok ? anything serious ? Well I thought it was infected, but fortunately it wasn't.","thats really good to hear , infections are a serious matter glad your ok"
"I really do not like doctors.  I hate going, I am freaked out by surgery, etc..   Oh really? What makes you not like them? I don't know exactly, I just don't.  When they decided we needed to do a c-section with my first child, I think I about lost it.  They had to give me something to calm me down.","Ugh I feel ya. They talked about that with mine, too. I almost passed out when they were doing the epidural!"
My family loves to argue when we get together. It is annoying when we are in a restaurant and won't stop bickering. I bet that is embarrassing for you when you guys are out in public.   You are right. Sometimes I want to be invisible. I wish we would all just get along.,"I understand, trust me.  My family was the same way growing up."
"I was driving home from work last night and some guy on his phone started coming into my lane.  I honked and he turned and flipped me off!  The nerve on that guy! I hate rude drivers like that.

"It was awful. I had a piano solo with a band that I joined and we play all over the place. Anyway, I bombed it and forgot a section so skipped forward and fumbled with the notes. Crushing. That's too bad. You're not quitting are you? I don't know.  I don't want to be remembered as the person who ruined the band and I think my band mates are a bit ashamed of me.",They will get over it
"One night, I was abducted by aliens. They probed me and I'm afriad they will come back.  That's a pretty wild story. Why do you think the aliens chose you in particular?

"I promised my daughter I would watch IT wih her tonight. Oh wow, that's a pretty scary movie.  I'd want company while watching it too. I am too scared though.

But besides it being scary it's a good film in general.  Hope you two can enjoy it.
"I was mad when my brother canceled plans tonight. I was looking forward to hanging out That sucks, Did you reschedule? Not yet, I hope we do",I hate when that happens. Especially when the same people do it over and over.

"I was super nervous about the day today as a semi family member has been acting up and I didn't want them to ruin anyones day. Oh, that is nerve-racking.You have to be on-guard. Did they behave themselves?  They did unfortunately. I'll just never understand people who like to make everyone else miserable just because they are. ",Ugh. I don't understand that either. And they make everyone so anxious just be existing. 
I wish I could sit around and eat and sleep all day like my cat. That would be great wouldn't it? They have it made! I so wish I could be a cat... ohhh how easy life would be!,Yeah but you also wouldn't live as long either. 
I live by myself. My apartment seems really empty some time.  I know that feeling.  I have a husband and a boyfriend living here and it still feels empty. That's really intersting? Maybe you need a cat to help?,Maybe maybe LOL.. I have four dogs.. argh!

I was hiking the other day and I ran across a dead deer with maggots eating on it. It smelled so bad! I bet that was disgusting! I would bring a noseplug from now on.

"My daughter will be in high school next year Oh man, I feel for you.  Kids grow up so fast.  Do you feel prepared for it? I don't. She is a young woman now and its too much for me lol ",I hear you.  I have a 8 year old daughter and it feels like she was born yesterday.  
"Someone just stole my car. That sucks? Did you see anything? No, I was asleep.  I have never been so mad in my life.  The police say I should just expect to never see it again.",I can imagine. I had a car stolen once while I was at work. Broke my heart
Pretty envious that my friend can go out and buy a new car with the snap of a finger. Ohhh gotta hate that friend!   What do you drive? An old beat up car that I need to replace but can't afford to.,I drive a gianormous conversion van
"I moved to a different state for my husband's job and left the rest of my family behind. oh, dear. That sounds lonely. How are you holding up? I'm doing okay. It was for a good reason, his new job is so much better. But it can get lonely","I can imagine. But you'll make new connections there, I'm sure."

"I have been struggling with a flare up from my Rheumatoid Arthritis after I had such a long period of feeling good. Its depressing to be in bed all day and fail your family in what you need to be doing. I am sorry you have that. It must be rough Thank you. Yes, chronic illness can be really hard.  I try to stay positive because I know it makes a different on my health to stay optimistic.  But this flare came suddenly and its horrible to be back in bed.",I can only imagine
"I was pretty nervous starting my new job. I was not sure what to expect Wow, congratulations on getting a new job!  I think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job.  What do you do? Its in production",That sounds fun. Have you done something like it before or is the whole kind of job new to you?  Good luck and I know you'll do great!  Act confident even if you don't feel like it. Sometimes that can help.
"I was a lonesome weekend. All of my friends were busy Sometimes that can be a good thing? It's not always so bad! I guess, I got through it",Maybe next weekend will be better for you!
I can feel a cold sore coming on on my lip! Quite a frustrating thing before a big job interview I have! I hate when those come around They take forever to go away!,I am sure it will soon
"I lied to my friend today and told him I was too busy to hang out because I just wanted to be alone. I do feel sort of bad. you should not feel bad ,we all need alone time I agree with you, but I can't help it. Maybe I should have just been honest with her.","honesty is great and all , but sometimes you need some time to yourself, i feel you on that tho"
I was a little unsure going to a movie alone tonight. It did not feel right There is nothing wrong with that at all. I've done it a few times before. Nobody in the theater knows or cares that you're there alone. Yeah it wasnt so bad,"If you always wait for somebody to come with you, you may miss out on a movie that you want to see as well. So there's that."
It must be nice for people to go on exotic vacations every time they turn around. I would love to do that as well Where would you go first?,I would love to go to hawaii

"Took my son to ER because he had a sore throat.  They misdiagnosed it and it got worse. Oh no! That's not good at all.

I hope that helped enough!
"It's the middle of the night and someone is banging on my garage door! That's quite scary!  Are you able to see who it is? No, I can't see anything and I'm too scared to look out a window!",You might want to call 911 if they continue banging on the door.  Better safe than sorry!
"When I baked Christmas cookies last year I meant to bring some to my neighbors. But I had to eat a few first. Oh, no.  I think I see where this is headed.

That has happened to me before.  Sometimes, it's just too hard to pass up.  Thank you for sharing.  "
i was mad when i returned to my car and noticed someone put a dent in my car That would really anger me as well.  What did you do?

"
"I cooked for family last week and it tasted pretty bad. I know they noticed, but they didn't say anything. Your family was being polite. If I did that my family would order a pizza, hah. I can tell they were just being polite too. I let myself down. I'll have to focus more next time.",It's all good. Maybe you should try something simple like Hamburger Helper.

"I am going zip-lining in Colorado in a week. There is only one problem I am really scared of heights! wow .. so am i .. i could not imagine doing that. its great that you are going to do it though If not for my wife pushing me to do it, I don't think I could be brave enough!",i wish you good luck.. 
"This morning I found a garden snake in my yard! It wasn't very big but I don't like snakes. Oh, my dad use to play with those all the time when we were young and he'd let us touch them! Really? I would probably run the other way lol","I never did want to hold it, but I was curious enough to touch it! They're actually kind of cute."
I've been putting off buying a computer part that I needed and just noticed it went up 10%! I'm pretty mad at myself. Oh no!

My hard drive is getting pretty old and running slow.,Well good luck! I know how frustrating that can be

Don't they know it's a one day holiday? I mean, a few days before and after is fine, but a whole month.  That is pretty inconsiderate of your neighbors",I agree. It must be hard to get any sleep. I feel bad for any animals in the area too!

I just started a month long class for work in a town that I have never been. I feel so isolated in my hotel by myself. That sounds lonely. Maybe you should try to hang out with some of your classmates? They are all a lot older than me.  I would feel out of place.  I just wish there was someone my age I could hang out with.,I hear you. At least it is only for a month. Maybe you can make some weekend trips to do fun things.
Once I put my shirt on inside out by accident. I didn't realize it until someone told me at school. That's hilarious!  Did you try to play it off like you meant to do that? No I'm not that hip. I felt kind of dumb and made some excuse about being in a hurry.,"Well, at least you were honest about it.  I bet you will never put your shirt on inside out again!  So, consider it a lesson learned!"
"I opened an old box of my grandfathers possessions that I was given after he passed away and found his watch that he always wore. I became really nostalgic and thought of all the good times I had with him. It is always good to take the time to reflect on happy memories.  I do that from time to time myself Yeah, it make me smile and appreciate the time I did have with him.",I am glad you were able to look back fondly and remember that good times.
"One the way to work, I got a flat tire and I missed a very important presentation.  I was pretty upset. Oh, man!  That is a nightmare!  Was your boss upset with you?

"My cat of 15 years passed away today... Oh no, why are all the pets dying. It is so sad when that happens. I have no idea why it's happening all at once, but I had that cat for a good long while. He was such a great cat. ",I bet you will miss your feline friend. Hopefully they are in a better place now.
One day I walked out front door and there was a coral snake laying there. I jumped and ran back inside I would have done the same! I don't like snakes Me either! Not at all! ,I found a garden snake in my yard the other day and despite it being little it still creeped me out
"I accidentally spilled my coffee on my date a few days ago Oh no! Inquiring minds want to know... is there plans for a second date? Sadly no. Or, at least not yet. She hasn't exactly been eager to respond. Poor me","Well, you don't want to date someone who doesn't like coffee anyway. :)"
I just moved to a new city for my job. That's great! How does that make you feel? I don't know anyone here and there's nothing to do.,You should go out and meet friends! Go out and do hobbies that you like. I bet you'll meet some new friends. Are you in a big city?
Someone let my dog out while I was at work! I can't believe it! Who let him out? Did he run away? I have no idea! I came home and my backyard gate was open. I can't find him anywhere.  ,Oh that is so sad. I hope you find him!

Sometimes when you ""give up"", someone good comes along Well unless it falls on my lap I will be by myself for the time being.

"I have done my grocery yesterday. I didn't pay for a chocolate bar. I feel bad about it. Man, that sucks. Are you going to go back and return it or did you eat it already? I didn't eat yet but I can't return it. ",I say in that case don't worry about it. Mistakes happen.
"There was this one time when my family was on a roadtrip and we got lost in the middle of no where at night. That should have been scary? Yeah, it was pretty frightening. But we eventually found a small city. ",Nice. How did you find the city?
"There was a similar situation when I was trying to catch a softball and ran smack dab into a fence. Ouch, I bet that must have hurt! It did indeed. For the next few weeks I was too scared to even try and catch another ball. ",That could be some trauma there... but I am sure you will get back into the swing of things (no pun intended).
"I was going to go to a work picnic today, but it didn't happen thanks to rain. That is unfortunate. Did they reschedule the picnic? Yes, we will try again next week. I was mad about it but now I feel okay.",I'm glad you feel better knowing that it will happen next week.
I was feeling rather anxious the other day because I smoked a ton of pot Were you doing it in a public place? Weed can do that to someone. No I was home alone. I kept on fearing that I would get caught if someone came home,You may want to smoke less next time. Do it in moderation.
I am fat. I feel ashame when I have to change clothes in the men locker room. That's too bad.  Have you given serious thought to trying to lose weight? I am trying but I never reach my goals.,"Hmmm.   I encourage you to keep trying.   Even if you don't ge tto your dieal weight, just getting halfway would show trememndous progress."
The situation was very unfair and I was treated as if I didn't matter after working there for over 5 years Wow im sorry to hear that. It sucks when something goes wrong at a job you've been there long I know.  I worked my tail off for that company.  After I was fired they called me a week later to tell me they realized it wasn't my fault but I had already found a new job and told them to take a hike.,I'm glad you found a job quick! That must have felt a little good to tell them at least
"I ordered a gift for a friend and it says it was delivered but I never received it. Now the company says it takes 14 days for a refund Don't you hate how ""customer service"" has no service anymore?  Did you get the refund at least? Still waiting..... That's the most upsetting. Because they waste no time taking your money",I'm sorry that you had to experience that.  It's totally unfair!
"I love Marvel and DC, but i'm not so sure I should join the Comic Book Club at school. Why you don't want to join the comic book club? What if people think I'm a nerd? This will be my first year at a new school. ",I understand. You could find a book club outside school.
"I was looking at pictures of when I got engaged and can't believe how time has flown by, 14 years later. Congrats! Time really does fly by, doesn't it? What was your favorite moment from it all/ It does!  I was so young! My favorite moment was when he was acting nervous and talking on and on and I had no idea what was happening, right before he proposed...it was so cute.","Aww, that does sound quite lovely. Before you know it it'll be 20 years! Any special plans then?"

"I was at the mall and when I got back to my car, it wouldn't start. I know nothing about cars and didn't know what to do besides calling my husband. Thankfully he was able to figure it out I'm glad he was able to help.  Was the battery dead? yes that was the problem... he came and brought a new one. thankfully it wasn't anything major","Yes, because a dead battery is much easier to fix than a busted starter or ignition switch.  :D  "
I had a rough time in the hospital back in march of last year. I got pretty sick and was stuck in there for a week. So sorry to hear that. What happened? Is it something serious? It was weird and out of the blue. I developed appendicitis and diverticulitis at the same time. My bowels tried to kill me.

"I had an unexpected emergency pop up and I couldn't make it in to cover him.I felt really bad for not being able to cover him. Did he get mad at you? Yeah he was really frustrated with me. I really hope he forgives me, and lets me make it up to him.","Buy him something sweet, like a chocolate cake, it usually helps."
There was this one time that a really rude customer yelled at my workplace. I was really not having it. What did you do? I just tried to remain calm and and took it. What would you have done in that situation if you had the chance?,"Same thing I guess, it's hard to imagine such situations."
"I just broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. She left the apartment to me. I'm all by myself.  I'm sorry. Do you enjoy having the apartment to yourself? No, I don't like being the only one here. There's so much space here for one person. ",That's true. I hope you find someone new to share it with.

I spoke with numerous active and reserve personnel about their basic training experiences.  There wasn't much positive in what they shared so my mind wallowed in what lay ahead.

"When I was little my grandma gave me a little ceramic cat. That is awesome, what kind of cat was it? I am not sure, just a little black and white one. I still keep it on display in my room because it reminds me of her.","That is great, make sure you pass it on to your kids as well!"
"i have a friend on facebook that posted a weird meme of someone mixing milk , nes quick and maya and swore its so good ... i almost threw up in my mouth  I just almost threw up a bit when you described it to me.  So I understand oh man it was so nasty , i did not think that was a thing ",I cannot imagine anyone wanting to drink that without losing a bet
I am so upset with my kids. What did they do this time? Kids are always getting into stuff. They never go to bed at a decent time. I can't get any sleep and am always rushing for work in the morning ,Those bums. Maybe then need to be reminded who is the boss.
"I ate half a sandwich before realizing the bread was old and moldy! It was gross! Oh no, I can imagine how you must have felt when you realized.  Did you get sick? It didn't make me sick, but it definitely made me FEEL sick for a short period. I guess mostly mental.",I can understand that too....  Did you double check the bread before the next sandwich?
I just finished moving and got charged double what I was quoted by the moving company! That is not cool. I sure hope they fix their mess up quick!

"I'm furious, I was almost killed by a semi-truck because he just randomly merged into my lane without looking! That's terrible. Was anyone hurt? No, luckily I swerved into the outer-most lane and there wasn't a car there. Thank God! You're lucky. That could have been really bad. Did he stop? Nope, just kept going like nothing happened!",He shouldn't have a license.

"When I was a kid, my house was hit by a tornado, I was scared to death! Oh no! How did you and your family do? Was the house damaged? Thankfully everyone was ok, but yes, the house was hit good and we had to move.","Hopefully that never will happen to you again, that is terrible."
"My girlfriend was feeling nauseous this morning and thinks she's pregnant. She went to get tested, and I am praying that she isn't.  I can imagine you are nervous.  What will you do?

"We just hired an exterminator last week for silverfish.  Now we have them worse than ever! I have never heard of silverfish, but if you have to hire an exterminator that sounds serious. I hope you are ok! They are bugs that get everywhere in the house.  I am pretty hacked off at the exterminator for not doing his job right",That is really annoying to hear. I would be so furious if I was in your position.
MY neighbors have been moving in for a month Wow that is a long time. Why is it taking so long? I don't know but they bring in furniture almost every day. And they do it late at night. It;s annoying ,That is pretty annoying for sure. I hope they get moved in so they stop bothering you.

They gave everyone a refund and also free tickets.","refund and tickets wont do anything , someone messed up big and they need to be fired "
"I got locked out of my house today because I forgot my key. I called my parents and they were mad at me. It happens. Maybe you should hide one somewhere in case you get locked out again.

"My father is going to give me a watch that has been passed down for 3 generations! Wow, that sounds pretty special. Are you his only child? Yes, and it really means a lot to him, so it's putting pressure on me to have kids!","Uh oh, well only have kids if you really want them. "

My friends from high school decided to gather and have dinner together. I was the only one left out. So disappointed in them That's kind of rude for them not to invite you. You should tell them you were hurt. I think i will just let it go and not to talk to them ever again. Such times provide good lesson to learn who is true friend and who is not,You are right. Now you know who your real friends are.
Nothing makes me mad like when people leave their grocery carts in the middle of the parking lot. How inconsiderate is that? True. i think the store should introduce some policies for punishing such individuals with fines Aldi has the right idea.

I found out that my girlfriend has been cheating on me. He sucks I am so hurt right now.,Forget him. There are soo many girls out there.

I got locked out of my house today and couldn't shower despite being really sweaty. Sorry to hear that.Are you still locked out? Yes I am just at my friends house waiting for my parents to come home to unlock it.,"Well, you just have to be patient."
I feel so alone these days Why? I will be your friend if you need friends. I just moved to a new city and I do not know anyone.,Take a chance and go to a coffee shop or bar.

The government is increasing taxes again. They keep increasing taxes without explain why. Most of our taxes are stolen by them. Excatly!

But I am glad I overcame the fear.",I'm glad you didn't pass out! I don't know if I would be able to go through with it.
I saw a Facebook post depicting suffering Syrian children that my friend shared on Facebook. I feel so sad for those innocent kids That's very sad.  Are you planning on going to syria to help them?

"I'm trying to get rid of house gnats. Tell me about it, they have to be in my top 5 things I hate the most. Yep, they are a real pain in the neck.",Plus they are so small it's harder to kill them for me. Flies are larger so I have an easier time getting rid of them.
"I was doing a morning jog the other day and I ended up stepping in dog poop. Uggh, what a buzzkill. Yea, I will definitely be paying closer attention to my surroundings from now on.",I'd say that is definitely true for you now.

"I was extremely emotional when my dog passed away Aww man sorry for your loss, those are the worst, its like losing your best friend. I hope he passed away peacefully and happy. It was actually rather tragic, but I'll spare you the details. He had a good life though. He was my dad's son lol","Aww shoot, I lost a dog when i was little in a very tragic way as well.

"Today while walking on the street I passed a dog that seemed to be lost but I didn't stop to help him find his owner. Aw, poor fellow, well I'm sure he was close to his home. I hope so, I don't feel good about myself  not helping him but I was in a hurry.","There's always next time, forgive yourself and help the next pupper you see!"
"I'm really bummed out today, I had to get rid of my dog because I had to move across the country. Oh you must be so sad, I know I would be if that had happened to me.

"Oh great. There was a big spider in my room, so I went to get something to scoop him up with (or flatten, I hadn't decided between the two yet). I come back and he's disappeared.  oh oh, so now you don't know where your enemy is hiding.  Sounds scary. It's scary and annoying because now I have to systematically check every inch of my room because I'm definitely not sleeping here with that big ol spider somewhere in my room!","How annoying, but would be wise imagine it jumping on you while you sleep."
"I'm disappointed with how my garden is turning out, everything is either dying or being eaten by rabbits. So what would you do to halt that? My husband is going to build a fence around it and I'm going to take better care and study more about the plants.",Thats thoughtful!\
"He promised to give me the said sum of money, on reaching there,i learnt he had travelled  That's not good, do you think he will pay you? Well, i needed the money urgently!","You can take out a loan, but good luck, I hope you get it!"
One day I went to school with a stain on my pants and I didn't realize it. I didn't find it until I came home.  And no one told you about it?  Maybe no one noticed it at all? No they noticed. Everyone was laughing at me but I didn't know why. ,That is horrible!  I hope they realize that their reaction was not exactly nice.
"I found out yesterday that my dad had a stroke last month! Oh my! I hope is ok! He's fine, almost fully recovered thanks to some quick thinking doctors.  But I'm upset that no one told me until just now.",Yeah that is a really suckying thing to do to you.

I really wish I had been able to finish that project yesterday. I'm sorry to hear that you couldn't finish it! What couldn't you finish? It was a project for work. I was going to get a bonus if I met yesterday's deadline. I could really kick myself about not being able to finish on time. ,Hey you are being too hard on yourself. I'm sure your boss would prefer it done well and not rushed. 
"I never realized it as a kid, but... that scene in Bambi, with the mother, it really is sad! Yes! I always cried when I watched it as a child. The cold, harsh snows of winter blowing around him, the unresponsiveness as he prods and cries at his mother... so sad!",Yes! My kids cried too 
"I've never been a big roller coaster fan.  I don't know if  you like them or not, but they scare me. Oh I love the thrill of a good roller coaster. Well, someone I was conned into getting on one and before I knew it, I was strapped in and could not get off.  I literally felt my heart stop.",It's definitely not for everyone.

"Whenever I work in my garden the mosquitoes eat me alive. It is the worst experience! Omg yes, mosquitos are awful. Do you use any spray? I tried some but it didn't help that much. I think I need some citronella candles to handle the pesky critters!",Nothing seems to for sure keep those things away but the bites are the worst.
"I locked myself out of my car the other day. Oh no! I hope it din't take that much to get in.  I had to call my husband to bring his keys, but it was a bit embarrassing.",Yeah but at least you didn't have to pay someone to break into your car for you. 
"Late last year I invested in cryptocurrency when everyone was hyping it up and I was expecting great returns this year. Well, I've gotten great LOSSES. Pretty bummed out. I don't know much about cryptocurrency at all.  You were brave to invest in a new thing, but I'm sorry that you lost money. I've learned my lesson. I need to do a little more research from now on. ",Maybe you can find a new investment that will give great returns and you can recoup what you lost.
"I've always thought that I liked my alone time.  However now I'm not so sure. Are you feeling more lonely than you expected? Well, my girls went on a mission trip this summer and the house was way too quiet during the day, it was too much alone time I think.",I get that way too when my kids are away for too long. It's good to find someone to hang out with to keep yourself occupied.

Maybe I should start checking my pants more often.","Yeah, or buy pants without zippers. But don't stress it, i'm sure whoever saw it didn't really mind!"
"It's tough being picky. Yes, I'm a picky eater. You ever have the situation where somebody buys doughnuts for your group, and somebody else eats the last one of the only flavor you like? ","Yes, I hate that. I usually end up going back and getting some more just for me."
"I really though a was going to get hired for a  job after I had this great interview, but they called to tell me they had hired someone else. wow ,try next time! Yes sure, but it was such I nice job, and I thought I had nailed it.","well, thats how fate would have it"
"Poor service delivery by an airline staff really pissed me I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened? I missed my flight and simply pleaded with her to change to the next available ,she just snubbed me",I know how frustrating it can be when we receive so an awful service.  They should train people to do a better job.
"When I was 15 my dog died. I'd had her since I was 4 years old. Practically my whole life at that point. That is so sad. I know how it feels to lose a pet. Yeah, I think I cried for a whole week. What kind of pet did you lose.",I lost a goldfish once. She was my best friend.

I have decided to move my son to a new daycare that is closer to home. That sounds rather convenient. Are you giving up anything for that? I am just really hoping that it's the right choice. He is leaving the only friends that he has known so far.,"If it's too traumatic for him, you can always try to put him back."
Someone hit my car in the parking lot and didn't even leave a note. I was so livid there is a big scrape on my door. I would be so mad. I can't believe people can do that and sleep at night Yeah I really was ticked off. I hope karma catches up with them one day.,I hope so too. That is just not right. They could have left a note at least.
"I am moving hundreds of miles away from my friends and family to start a new life with my husband. wow! love birds,how nice,so where exactly are you headed? Headed to Mystic, CT for his job.

"I planned a picnic with a friend and it rained. Oh, that's too bad. Perhaps have the picnic indoors? It wouldn't be the same, but at least you could share food and have a laugh! We had to cancel. I was upset that it ruined our plans.","I can imagine. That's the problem with planning outside events - we can't dictate the weather. You should try planning something outdoors in Scotland, where I'm from - soggy food every time!!"
We were told that he had colorectal cancer!  Who has cancer? Someone you know? My husband was diagnosed with this type of cancer. I really needed to talk to you about it. ,Well I am no cancer expert. Probably should get a second opinion from a doctor.
"I hears some very strange noises coming from under my bed last night. I am too scared to look. Could be the bogeyman. LoL....no sweetie, I'm sure it's your dog again. Didn't the same thing happen last month? I don't have a dog and I just moved in the house yesterday. It was listed at 50% off and came with appliances. Maybe there was a reason for it.",Oh sorry about that I thought you had a dog. Well then maybe the noise the some type of critter. Have you checked under the bed today?
"My girls had to take biology last year - they dissected a frog. I remember that. A lot of people were grossed out and didn't want to do it. Were your girls one of them? No, but I was.

My teacher had us dissect fish as well and I prefere that much more for some reason"
"My cat has been battling cancer for a couple months and has had 2 surgeries. I'm so sorry to hear that, my girlfriend's cat is going through the same thing right now. It can't be easy. I think next week we will have to put her down.",That's so sad... The best thing you can do is spend lots of time with her and make every minute count. I wish you all the best.
What does it take to not ever have someone in one's life Usually people want someone in their life. I guess that takes staying away from others. I think maybe their lifestyle make them not to have space for others,Some people prefer to be alone. Whatever makes them happy I suppose.

The other day I was driving somewhere unfamiliar and I got lost. I hate when that happens. I'm so bad with directions. It was pretty scary. The GPS on my phone stopped working and I felt panicked. What did you end up doing? I stopped at a gas station and asked for directions. Thankfully someone friendly was willing to help!,"I depend so heavily on my GPS, i don't know what i would have done"
I felt so dumb when I realized the shirt I was wearing was inside-out. I bet so many people noticed. Oh man that had to be embarrassing.

I must have been really distracted that morning.,Well it will probably never happen again so don't worry about it to much
"My grandfather passed away over a year ago, and I was looking at some of the older photos I have of him and I as a kid. I'm so sorry. I know that must be very difficult for you. It's nice that you have pictures to look at and remember old times together. I have a very bad memory, so you're right. The pictures really help me remember times I really enjoyed with my grandfather when I was young.",Pictures are a great way to remember the past. I treasure every picture. Each holds a special memory.
I felt guilty yesterday because I yelled at my kids.. We all do it. I bet they deserved it. They were being loud and obnoxious and not listening. ,They sound like my kids. I hope they start behaving better for you.
I was so upset when my dog chewed up the model airplane I was building. He thought it was a toy. Now I got to get a new one. Dogs can be so destructive. I don't blame him but I was pretty upset because I spent so much time working on it. I will keep him out of my room this time.,Poor thing had no clue why you were mad
I took a bus trip to Philadelphia today. The bus was totally gross. There was sticky stuff on the floors and there was a horrible smell too. Oh that sounds horrible.

"Man sometimes I find myself at work just being frustrated over the fact that I know there is work available but I can't grasp it because pople aren't playing fair. you ever had that issues?

That's frustrating!"
"Part of my job is to clean up the bathrooms at the end of the night. Usually it's not so bad, but last night someone stuck so much toilet paper inside of the toilet that it overflowed EVERYWHERE.

My dog died 5 minutes ago. I am so distraught. That is a real bummer. Maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life. I think you are right.

Think about all the good times you had together."
I am really worried I will flunk my Geometry test. I just don't get the material. That really stinks. Have you gone to get some help on it? I'm going to call my friend that is a math wizard. Maybe he can help me understand this stuff.,I am sure he will be able to help you. I hope you pass.
My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. Oh no. That sounds like a messy situation. It does indeed. I was so mad at him!,Hopefully he'll learn that that's not the place to do that.
My best friend got the prettiest girl in the class. I wish I had his game. I am better looking but he gets the girl every time. I am sure once you clean up your scruffy look you'll be able to land all the ladies. I thought the mountain-man look was in this year. You think deodorant would help too?,"Nah, you can forgo deodorant. The media just tells everyone it's necessary since it's a poorly known method of government mind control."
"My dog pooped on the rug today. He must be related to my dog. Was it hard to clean up? Yeah, considering it was a 100 lb mountain. I was so mad at the little tyke that I put him down.",You may want to check his diet. Something in not right there.
My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. Oh no! Is your dog trained to go outside? He is. I am quite anxious thinking about cleaning it up. I hate germs.,"I'm sorry to hear that.

"My dog pooped on the rug today. You are the 2nd one today. Was it a mile high? Oh, it was 2 miles high. I was so angry as I shoveled it into the furnace.",That must have been quite the workout. At least you should have plenty of fuel for the winter.
someone cut me off in traffic today Shocking. Does that not happen often for you? no i was so mad when it happened,Ah well better than me. I get it so much it doesn't even bother me anymore.

I was just over at some friends multi million dollar house for their sons birthday party... Nice! Did you steal anything while you were there? Gosh I ate as much of the food as possible.

I really miss the days my parents took me to the fair. I loved to go on the rides and eat candied apples. That sucks. Did you ever find any worms in the apples? No but I would like to. I hear they are a good source of protein. I miss the good old days.,"Yeah, if only I could go back and have a crisp apple with some snake oil...all would be right with the world."

I thought it was scary",That's something that's easy to laugh about after the fact but I bet you were running for your life when it happened! Haha
"So usually I like taking out the trash because it makes you seem useful but it's really easy. Today though I almost threw up, the dumpster was absolutely vile and I have no idea why. I know what you mean.  Its an easy chore, but sometimes that smell is gross.  Its that sweet smell. yuck Yeah, sweet is a way to describe it.

That person needs to loose their license I believe - you are so blessed you were not hurt.

"My dad and I were talking about the past, just reminiscing a bit. I'm going to miss these times. I miss my dad.. been so long.   What did you guys talk about?

My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. I was so grossed out cleaning it up. Ewwwwwwwww! Was it a runny poop or a solid poop? Thankfully it was solid. I would have died if it was runny and all over the place.,Yeah I would have totally done the same. That's why I don't want a dog lol!

Many of those folks with nice houses have mountains of debt. It causes a lot of stress.

It can be so disappointing when something like that ruins your perfect plans.

"I had made a bad mistake on a work project, and my coworker took the blame for it. I felt bad for not speaking up to my boss. That really sucks. Did you make it up to your co-worker? I apologized to them later about it. It was tough hearing our boss scolding them about it though.",That's good to hear that you and your co-worker mad amends. Live and learn!
"I ate 10 pizzas last night. I never felt so bad about myself. Whoa! Did you have a strong craving or something? I did! I satisfied it, but I never felt so shameful...",That's okay to give in sometimes and enjoy the moment. 
I went to the skating rink all by myself yesterday. All you must have been proud of yourself I wasn't. My friends ditched me. It was a terrible time.,That's so terrible. How could they ditch you!!

"When i see a high end cars. I just envy them Yeah, I wish I had a nice car too. How did people manage to buy so nice one's  and am just jealous of them",It would be nice to have money like that.
"I am feeling extra guilty about not sticking to my diet. I ate so much fried foods and a whole ice cream sundae by myself! I too feel your pain.

"Someone lit a bag of poop on fire on my neighbors sidewalk last halloween.  The smell of it is something I won't soon forget. lol hey at least it was your neighbors sidewalk and not yours I know.  I didn't even know that was something people really did, I thought it was just in the movies...Gross!",Maybe you should find out who did it and go throw toilet paper all over their yard!!
My wife is  off to her Mom's for couple of days Dang. Do you have the whole house to yourself? yeah but i think i am going to miss her and feel alone,That's really rough. Maybe you should go to the gym and meet some friends?
"My dog pooped on the rug today. That is funny. Dogs can be careless. You should take better care of it Well, it won't be an issue anymore. I put it up for adoption. This was the last straw!",You seem to be very fed up with him. How long have you had him?
"Seeing Republicans clearly and directly rejecting notion of climate change makes me terrified of our future as a species It makes me feel the same.

They maybe careless with their sanitary responsibilities
"I just can't stand it anymore. My partner nags almost about every detail of our relationship. Just yesterday, she criticized my taste for clothing That would get very irritating.

"I let out a moist, warm fart today in front of all of my co-workers today. You must be very comfortable in your office! How did they react? Some ran away in terror. Others in disgust.

I'm guilty as charged! :)",better hop on the elliptical for a little longer tomorrow!  Worth it!
"I'm not really sure if I am going to be able to find a gift for my wife's birthday. Why not? I had ordered it about 6 month's ago because it was a custom made gift, but the company called me and told me that it broke in the final step.  I was supposed to get it tomorrow and there is no way that I will get it on time.  I just don't know what to do now. ","Oh no, that's awful.

You should try white noise and black out curtains.

"I went to a fast food drive thru and the cashier refused to give me my correct change or the receipt. That would make me angry, and it is impossible to deal with in a drive thru.

I really hate driving off only to find out a third of your order is wrong or missing!

"Every time I park my car in my apartment's parking lot, someone parks way too close to me. It's annoying! That's so frustrating! Do you know who it is? It seems to be random people each time, I think they just made the spacing way too close.",Sorry to hear that. Maybe you and the other tenets can lobby for additional parking somehow?
I'm in a new city and don't know what to do. That could be kind of scary. Have you tried to meet anyone that might could show you around and then maybe you would not be so lonely?

Your hard work lost, and she probably feels really guilty too, for something that was maybe an accident. I hope you guys were able to talk it out and not get too upset with one another after a while."
"Yesterday at work during lunch I noticed my shirt was inside out. Who hasn't that happened to before! If it took you that long to notice, I bet no one else noticed. Were you able to fix it later?

I miss them! ,I recommend taking some time to explore the city and find an hobby or interest and join some groups. It takes time to find a new set of friends.
I just got some crushing news. I just got a call to tell me I did not get the job I really wanted. Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that!  Yea it was a really great opportunity too. It will be hard to find something similar.,Hopefully something similar will come up soon. Maybe you can check for another position in the company you're hoping for!
I was insanely upset when our CAR got a ticket for being on my OWN lawn. did you get it dismissed? They said I had to move it within so many days or they would TAKE it...Are you kidding me?. They say it's city property yet I mow it and maintain it..and pay taxes on it..Yet I can't park my car on it? ,thats the law!

It is my friends birthday today and we had lunch together. What did you guys eat? I had a hamburger with a large black hair in it!,"lol, did you tell your friend about the hair?"

"Someone asked me to come pick them up at a specific place at a specific time. I was a little busy at the time, but I relented. Then they sat there and took 30 minutes longer than they said they would, and I had to sit around waiting in the car. How are people that inconsiderate? Are you one of the Uber drivers? No, not an Uber driver. That'd be a little more understandable. It was just a friend who was running an errand and got stuck. Last time I do that for them any time soon. ",Did they apologize to you?
I like to wear my fathers watch that I inherited. Its a nice reminder of him. That is a nice way to remember him. Its good that you have something of his to keep his memory alive. It really makes me feel like he is right there with me sometimes.,I'm sure that's an awesome feeling. 
"I just told a friend I couldn't attend her birthday because I have a headache, but the truth is I prefer to stay home and finish watching a series on Netflix.

I hate having to buy presents for other people. Oh. Do you have to buy a lot of presents or do you just not know what to buy? I just don't know what I should buy. It makes me nervous. I understand.

"My husband and I recently decided we are going to get a puppy! I was really excited when I put the deposit down, but when I went to tell my mom about it she got really negative and talked badly about our decision. It was really frustrating and made me not feel great. What was she so negative? The dog breed we decided on is a rather large one and she was worried that we hadn't done our research. We have young children so she was concerned we didn't think about them first.",What kind of dog is it?
"I was supposed to take a flight tomorrow, but there is supposed to be a storm at the time Oh that's terrible, getting delayed always annoys me Well I am more worry about not about the delay, but about flying with a storm around.",Oh yes that sounds a little dangerous I wouldn't take that flight unless it was necessary.

I baked a bunch of cookies for my neighbors. Unfortunately I ate them all instead. I have no self control! Haha oh no. Sometimes you need a cheat day. This happens way too often. I think I may need to find a 12 step program for my cookie addiction.,Maybe next time have a huge meal before you start baking. That way you arent hungry. 
My mailman didn't make it by my house today and failed to deliver my order. He's usually never even late. Wow! Was your order important? Have you called the post office to find out what happened? no I haven't called yet there's still time for him to make it by but it's a little odd to be sure. Nothing important at least!,Well that's good. I hope her makes it before the end of the day and you get your package.
I was walking down my street and a big fly flew into my mouth. I tried to spit it out but it wouldn't leave. It tasted so nasty. Did you wind up eating it?

I would have definately kicked that guy out!"
"I was walking home the other day, and ran into a stray dog. It chased me for quite a distance. That is terrifying, did you get away from it? I climed over people's fences to get away from it, it finally lost me after a few of those.","That is good, who knows if the dog has rabies or not. It would be unpleasant to get bit! "

I was upset when my favorite TV show was canceled. Now I don't have anything to watch. Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch.  I will look but I hate it when they cancel good shows. It seems to happen too often.,I know what you mean. It seems they keep the crap shows going for years and the good ones get cancelled. 
I was driving home from work and a driver cut in front of me and made me almost hit another car. Did you flip the bird? Some people are so rude. I flipped a lot of birds and spewed some pretty angry words too. People drive so stupid sometimes. ,You should also post the license plate on social media. Sometimes public shaming does wonders.
"I cant believe it, 3rd try and stilla  fail. What did you fail? my college entrance exam, again.",How many times have you tried?
"Sometimes my daughters have too much homework. I almost feel like homework is counter productive. Shouldn't the schools be teaching the kids enough during their 8 hours? Yes, but there's not enough time in the day for all we do.","I guess you're right. Education isn't something that can be rushed! But still, I think homework is a little excessive."
"I spent a ton of money on computer upgrades and purchasing a new game I was excited for. Turns out it's actually pretty boring. I'm sure there'll be other games it will be useful for. Yeah. While I'm pretty bummed out, the only wasted money was on the game. It's always nice to have a power and fast computer. I built my own too a few years ago. That's awesome! So you're a gamer as well?","At times, though I don't have as much time anymore."
"So I had really good job interview. They just called to say they went with someone else. Im a little bummed about that. That's a shame, do you have anything else lined up? I do but I was really hoping I got that one.",There'll probably be something else
Recently I had a shift at work cancelled. Often that can mean that the rest of the week gets cancelled. Is that a bad thing? Sometimes it is nice but loss of pay for 20+ hours definitely made me a little nervous. Thankfully only the one was cancelled.,That's good
"I was talking crap to this guy for like 10 minutes and he all of a sudden just knocks me out Talk crap get smacked hahah thats right, I guess I learned the hard way.",Is this a true story
"I gor home from work the other day to find my cat had peed on the carpet. The smell was horrible. oh my god, thats it so gross, cat pee is the worst. It really is. Luckily, I had some cleaner for pet urine, but I was gagging the whole time I was cleaning.","im so sorry,  thats why im not the biggest fan of animals."
The ride I was going on went upside downs three times in total. That sounds like quite a ride. Are you a fan of rollercoasters in general? no I was scared out of my witts!,I understand that. I hate rollercoasters too.
I got in a wreck today. Someone cut me off on a wet road and slammed their brakes causing me to wreck. It makes me furious someone can drive so dangerously. Did it do much damage to your car ? Yea enough to have it get fixed. I was so mad. I had a big meeting at work that I had to miss.,"Well, I hope they had insurance at least."
"I dropped my allstart team trophy and it shattered everywhere Dang, that really blows. What was it made of, glass? some sort of ceramic material.",They should use metal. That never breaks. Sorry that happened to you.
I was laying in my bed last night and I heard footsteps walking down the hall. I was frightened because I live alone. Did you get up to go check to see what it was? Yeah I looked but didn't see anything. I did some research on my home and it turns out there are no records of it being built. Now I am terrified.,Thats absoulty terrifying to be honest.
I thought my son was doing good in school. When I got his report card I found out he failed his math class. I wish he had told me he was in trouble. It's hard for kids to do that. Maybe he was just bored? He was ashamed but I told him I was only upset he didn't tell me. I know how hard it is to admit failure.,It's hard for kids to do that. Maybe he was just bored?
I was all alone in my house and I heard something in my living room. What did you hear? It sounded like something breaking. I wasnt sure what to do.,That is so scary! I'm glad you're okay!
I haven't been liking the hot weather lately. Me either. ITs too much I'll be glad when Fall arrives.,Same here. Picnics and family time
Last week I baked a cake for my kid's birthday party. Somehow the dog jumped on the table and started scarfing it down. I was furious with him. Oh no! Did you scold the dog? Yeah I made him go outside and didn't give him any dog treats for a while. Luckily I had enough ingredients to make another cake.,I hope he doesn't get that one!
I am making my wife dinner with this new rub I bought for the chicken.  It That sounds so good! Yeah it's got coffee grounds in it... I'm pretty sure she's gonna hate it though.  Wish me luck!,"Oh no, I bet she ends up loving it!  Best of luck!"
"I was at a gas station with my friend and we both bought a lottery ticket. She won a little bit of money!

I tripped and fell in front of the cute barista yesterday. I dont feel like showing my face there again. Oh no! If it helps they probably don't remember.

I'm a very clumsy person myself, trip all the time."
"I quit my job recently, which was great. But I didn't have time to tell my good friend before leaving. I feel so bad now. Im sure they understand. That is a tough position to be in. Well she sent me an email checking in. And I responded but I think it filtered to her junk mail, she hasn't responded back.",Maybe try and reach out on social media to a few of them. Im sure they would love to hear from you.
It sucks seeing others make more money than me. I totally understand that feeling. It's very frustrating. All you can do is try your best and try not to pay too much attention to that aspect. That's true but social media makes it hard to be okay with my best. ,I think we all have our good days and bad days. Just keeping plugging along and I bet it gets better soon. It recently did for me.
I thought my job interview went well last week but I just found out I didn't get the job. That sucks. Yea I was a little bummed out.,I know how you feel. Keep your head up. Start putting out more applicaitons.

I was cleaning my basement and a huge rat jumped out at me. I nearly jumped out of my skin! A RAT! I would have died The worst part is now I can't find it anywhere. I am terrified it is still in my house.,You should get traps. You may have scared it away. I think only mice get scared though. Rats are like dinosaur mice

I'm scared she'll pass soon too Yeah  had to put her down because she was in so much pain. I don't know what to do without her.",That's so sad. I hope you feel better soon. I would be so devastated too.
"I stepped in bubble gum in the parking lot at work. That really sucks, I've had that happen to me as well. Some people just have no common courtsey.","I agree, most don't bother with something so simple like throwing away trash or returning grocery carts or holding open doors."
"I watch youtube videos all day because I'm so bored That really stinks. Maybe you should try and find something that your good at and do that! Yeah, I should really work on something I'm passionate about",What do you think you are really good?
"I really like my friend's Chanel bag, but I would never spend that much money on an accessory Maybe she will let you borrow it. Or maybe if she gets a new one she will give it to you. I doubt it, they cost 4000 dollars, it's crazy","That's way too expensive for a bag. What is it made of, gold? Haha."

"It's storming really badly outside at the moment. Really, where is that? I'm here in South Korea for work at the moment. A typhoon is coming.",Well at least you are not in the middle of the flight.
"My husband works really hard for our family and makes good money.  We've made choices to give our kids experiences rather than have the biggest house. Very wise of you, experiences are all that matters. But sometimes it is  hard going over to our friend's big homes and seeing another way to live as well.","I see, but you do realize that happiness for the most part is immaterial, right?"
"I stole a bottle of wine from the store. Do you feel guilty now? Yes, I feel really guilty about it!",How are you going to make up for it?

My cat was acting weird earlier. It was starting to scare me a bit Is you cat ok now? What do you think it is? He was just running around. I guess that is normal,Most likely. They can be skittish little things.
Man we're going to the amusement park this weekend Which amusement park? six flags.  I've never rode a coaster before! Roller coasters are fun but you should stay safe too. Yeah!  Maybe if I try one I'll like it. ,What other rides should you take?
"When we lived in an apartment, we had a lady with a dog above us. That's one thing I don't miss is having someone stay above me did they dog make lot's of noise? Not too bad, but she would let him go out onto her deck. One day he peed out there and it went all over our deck, our grill, everything basically!",That is so rude and disgusting I know you was a tad bit furious. 
There is a drug dealer selling drugs in my building. I am very afraid when I have to get out or in. That would make me SO angry. What kind of drugs is it? I would make sure the police took him out. The police doesn't come in my neighborhood. They are too afraid to come.,Well I have the same issue..they aren't afraid..they're just corrupt..but I just yell at those people myself. I don't put up with the ghetto corrupt crap
"A dude pulled up halfway in my driveway, beeping at me UNTIL I came out..like 50 times! Smoking and leaving his ashes everywhere Is he a pervert? He certainly gave me the creeps. Likely. He wanted to buy the rack off of a truck I have in the driveway. He can drive on by! .I am a woman..home alone..Seriously?

"I can't believe someone hit my car and took off! Some people have no morals. uh I've heard way too many people experience that. Why don't people just not hit you in the first place, if they don't want to take responsibility? Exactly... It's really not hard to back out of a parking spot to leave.",I really wish those people who get fined just like those traffic cameras that send you tickets in the mail for speeding. It would really reduce hit and runs.
I applied for an internship with a law office Very nice! I bet your more than excited about it! I am actually terrified. They probably laughed at my application Oh no! Dont be anxious or worried! I'm sure you did good on the application.  I hope so. Although I also wish I could take it back lol ,Have more confidence in yourself! Take pride in your work!

You'd think I'd get a lot done, but it's just so quiet.",Yeah pretty creepy. Turn on some music or something so you don't get too nervous or anxious. 
"I've been getting really bad headaches recently Headaches really suck, I'm so sorry to hear that. Any idea why you've been getting bad ones? No clue, maybe it's the lack of sleep? Or maybe I've been in front of my computer for too long","It could be. Also may be related to dehydration, and eye strain related to visual problems. Try and drink more water and have your eyes checked to be sure!"
I am so tired from today. I'm sorry to hear that. What's got you feeling so tired? I was running errands all day and the kids were terrible after school. It upset me that I cant relax when I need to ,"Being a parent really is a thankless job, until your kids get older and realize how tough it is."
"A random number won't stop calling me, even after I blocked them. I can't stand it! Oh man! That would scare the heck out of me  It's like phone scams but ugh I think I'm going to change my phone number",Would that even change anything?

"My debit card was blocked and called my bank to resolve the issue. Can you believe it, it took me hours until i could get to a representative. What an unacceptable level of customer service they have Yikes, maybe it's time to switch banks Indeed. I was thinking about it recently. In addition, they had been hiking their annual APR on my credit card without notifying me","Oof, are they even allowed to do something like that?"
"I got caught in the rain before work and arrived soaked That is bad. You should have immediately gotten a towel and dry yourself. You could get sick Yeah, I was just embarrased to show up to work like that",Did you spend the whole day with wet clothes at work? Didn't the manager allow you to go home and change?

They grow up so fast.,"I know it can be upsetting and emotional, but Im sure you are happy!"
"If things didn't go as planned we might not be able to make America great again What things are you wanting to go as planned?

"I cheated on my math test today. I feel horrible about it. Hmm..I think we've all been there one time or another.  Are you going to admit it? I'm really not sure. I feel like if I don't, I will never forget about it and continue my life with this rotten feeling.","Well you certainly don't want that hanging over your head for the rest of your life.  It sounds like you have a good moral outlook on life, I think you have to admit it."

I am so mad at what Andrew Cuomo said. These people are becoming so pathetic and out of touch with reality that logic and reasoning are becoming an aliens to them Who are these people you refer to?,People at CNN and the whole liberal media who ignore the reality of the people's lives and try to project their own moral wonderland onto them
"This Monday, for our team's weekly meeting, i am expected to make a big presentation about my progress on the project in front of the CEO of the company I work for. I am very nervous and full of anxiety You will do fine, just relax. These are just words. Everyone is saying them to me and I constantly hear them. But it just doesn't help. I can't just simply relax",Then be as prepared as you can.
I yelled at my dog to come inside. I feel so bad. Why do you feel bad? She didn't do anything wrong. I was venting out my impatience on her.,Oh. I'm sure she didn't mind it. Dogs seem to be a lot less sensitive than people.

My husband tells me not to say anything because then they will spit on my food.
"I went to the bowling alley all by myself because my friends ditched me. It was pretty darn awful. Did you have fun there by yourself at least?

We have to remember the good times with our loved ones!
"My dog peed on the rug for the near hundredth time today. I was so mad!  Oh I bet!  Did you take him outside? I do, but he always waits until we get inside to go. I just can't seem to get him to go inside. I might have to hire a professional...",I use puppy pads in my house in case my dog needs to use the bathroom in the house.   Those seem to work pretty good!
"a while back my manager had told me i would most likely get a promotion within the next few weeks. That's great news! You must be excited! well i was, hahaha its been at least a month now, and it seems like she has been avoiding me!",Oh gosh. Wonder why she won't be upfront about it.
"I'm scared a tornado will come in and destroy my city Tornadoes can be so terrifying. My house was swept up by one when I was a little kid.

"My prized, Argentinian goldfish died yesterday. I've never been so heartbroken. Oh no I am so sorry to hear that!  Thank you for the condolences, friend.

I hope you can at least cherish the memories you had together.
I was totally freaking out when I heard this crazy noise from the dumpster! I would have been running away. What did you do? I threw my trash into it as fast as I could and ran back to my car! I don't have any clue what was in there.,LOL....that trash would have been on the ground.
I stole some candy from the store. I felt so bad about it. Did this happen recently?  Did you take it back and admit the error? It did...I committed the heinous crime yesterday in a fit of gluttony. I haven't told anyone about it because the candy lies at the bottom of my thieving stomach. I don't know how I'll ever be able to sleep again.,"Well, you may want to think about admitting it to the store manager and paying for it.  Especially if it's bothering you this much, it's the ony way to resolve it."
"We were supposed to go out of town for labor day but we had to cancel. That really sucks. Is it because your mom was in the hospital? I am a psychic, so I tend to know these things.

"I was walking down the street and I saw a really creepy clown smiling at me. I got so scared. Oh man.  Now I am having images of the movie ""It"" in my head.  What did you do? I just ran home and hid underneath my bed. I looked out the window and it was on the street still staring at me. Now I can't leave my house!",That is unusual behavior for a clown.  I would say you might want to call the authorities.  There has to be a law against a creepy clown stalker
"My wife is off to her mom's. I will be alone and lonely without her Oh no! How boring. Could you call up a few buddies to hang out? Yeah , but the thought of not her being here makes me sad.",I can agree. Dont be too down. Im sure you can find someting to keep you busy. 
"My dog pooped on the rug today. I was livid! That's horrible. Were you able to get it up before it stained? I was, thankfully! I couldn't be mad at her for too long either. She is just a young pup after all.","Yeah, one look at a cute face like that and it's hard to be mad."
"I was livid when the pizza delivery guy showed up with only one of the pizzas we ordered for a party. That sucks. Did you tell him to go back and get the other one? Yeah, and he wasn't sorry about being over an hour late! We just cancelled the other part of the order.",I would've taken that pizza out of the box and smack him upside the head with it. What a lousy guy!
"My dog pooped on the rug today. I was so mad! Oh no! Did your dog have to go really bad or what happened? She's a mere puppy, so she is learning. But she was doing such a good job going outside then all of a sudden she goes inside! I was not happy.",Hopefully with enough training your puppy will let you know when she has to go. It takes time.
"I let out a moist, hot, smelly, loud fart in front of all my co-workers today. I don't think I can ever show my face again. That's awful. I hope you can find a new job.

If they were afraid of coasters, I would be too. Tread lightly, friend."

I am trying to cope with these challenges. I am not sure how far i can go on like this",Maybe you should go to a temp agency.
"My pet toad died, I am so sad. I am so sorry to hear that. How long have you had him? I have had him for five years.","You must have developed strong attachments to him over all these years. To be honest, I am not an animal lover individual"
I badly miss my hubby. Why did he left? He went to London for our business work.,"Oh, for how long he will be away?"

"You ever browse through old photos on a friend's Facebook page? Kinda weird right? I have. Sometimes it's nice to see what old friends have been up to, and what new friends have done.

My first dog died a year ago. He was only 4 years old. I am sorry for your loss. How did he die if you don't mind me asking? He had to have surgery because he ate something he shouldn't and it got caught. They told us he only had a 5% chance of survival and even then he would be in a lot of pain for a long time. We put him down to keep him out of pain.,That's terrible... At least you tried to save him.

I hope it didn't cause a lot of damage, I have a bunch of very tall trees in my yard as well. Unfortunately it did. It fell right on my shed and absolutely flattened. I have insurance but the shed had a lot of tools in it that held kind of a family heirloom value to me. ",That's terrible I'm sorry to hear that. I'm also glad you have insurance.
I'm feeling so regretful today. I went shopping and spent way more than I should have. I think I might have to return some of the things I bought. I hate that feeling. I spent $50 on groceries I didn't exactly need. so I know how you feel. I feel so badly that I bought a bunch of junk! I don't know what comes over me while I'm shopping! Ha!,If I remember right shopping triggers our happy centers. It is hard to stop

It's been 2 years, so I'm out of the habit of walking, cleaning, etc.",It might take a bit of time to get back into the swing of owning a dog. I'm sure you'll be ready soon if you still think it over.
"In the past, I was given a loving home with parents that helped me and a career path I could have succeeded on, and I blew it. It's never to late to continue on that path or find a new one.

"My storage unit got robbed while I was moving to a new home. They took all my family antiques and precious items. That's terrible.

","Well if they were family heirloom or photographs, I don't really think the money would have been important. The family passes down antiques and precious items for keeping."
"I know it's very petty of me but it is starting to bug me. My family has been very generous towards my adult sister as of late but have not really paid much attention to me. Have you tried talking to them about this?  This has happened on and off for years, and I always try to talk to them. I usually get no response. It's led me to be self-sufficient fortunately.

A lot of people sign up to work those camps every year."
"Oh boy I am livid! I just got this new couch from my family and my cats have already shredded an entire side of it. Oh no, that's such an awful thing for them to do. Do your cats often ruin things in the household? No, that's what's very shocking about this! They're decent cats. I know they're animals who don't know better but I really liked this couch. ",Oh odd. That's a good way to look at it though; too many people get too angry with their pets over these type of things.
"I don't know what will happen in the future if Global Warming is not stopped. Well from what i have read we will all be drowning which isn't good. And the fires too, there have been a lot of those lately, seems that worse than ever.",Yeah forest fires are getting really bad.
"I really screwed up today! I was working on a big pot of pit beef, followed the old family recipe, and it tastes like garbage! Odd! Any idea where you went wrong?

"Last week I ate my husband's leftovers, even though I knew he was looking forward to it. Oh no! Did he take it okay? I kind of pretended I forgot it was was his, and he believed me.

"We are really wanting wanting to buy a newer and bigger vehicle, but we're not sure if we can afford it. Oh no. Maybe you can find one that is used, or even rebuilt. I got my car for 75% less than what I would've paid from a car dealer! Problem is we don't have a car payment now and going back to having one would be a struggle. We are trying to figure out and pay off bills now.","Well, stick through it! I wish you luck :) "
"I ate a whole gallon of ice cream by myself in one sitting and now I'm not feeling too happy. Oh, I could do that if I didn't have bad teeth and can't handle the cold. I would regret it if I did though because I really need to lose some weight. Yeah, I'm telling myself that its okay since it was just a one time thing. I'll walk it off tomorrow! ","Lol, burn those calories. Hope you have a high metabolism."
"I love looking at old photos. Makes me miss the good old days. Me too. Old photos bring about such nostalgia. Yeah, even ones from 5 or 6 years ago! Especially ones of the kids.  ","I can only imagine! When my parents open old photo albums of my siblings and I, they get teary-eyed."
"I'm in a wedding party tomorrow, and I've been called upon to give a big toast during the reception. Wow, that's such an honor.  How do you feel about it?

My spouse had a brief affair last year. It ended and we are still together. Who was it with? A co-worker.  ,Were you more mad at them or your spouse?
"Oh I was so shaking in my boots. I was sitting outside on my patio and saw a shadowy figure inside my house! What was it?  Did everything turn out alright? At first, I jumped and ran in because I certainly wasn't expecting visitors. But it was my wife! She was home from work early! ",Phew! I'm glad that's all it was.
"New neighbors moved in this week, and they have a dog that looks almost exactly like my childhood dog. How interesting.  How does that make you feel? When I first saw it I felt like I had time traveled for a second.  So weird.","Yes, I think that would be a little surreal, and I might feel ambivalent about it."
"Oh I wish I could clear my closet out but I just can't part with these things. I felt the same way as you, but what's the point of keeping things you don't use and having it take up space? Do you use everything in your closet?  I don't use it but I've collected so many little things in memory boxes. It's really grown to a few boxes now.  ","So the items are sentimental to you? I know how hard it is to part with items that have memories behind them, but at the end of the day, they are just items! :)"
I went to make a patty melt today and my bread was moldy. Oh no! I hate when I'm hungry for something and it goes wrong like that! I know! It was a super specific craving I was having too. The worst!

Its hard at first, but with practice comes perfection.",That's the spirit. I bet you're a wonderful pianist.
I haven't slept well this week at all. The county has been drilling outside my house for 12 hours a day. Well that stinks.  What are they drilling for? They're ripping up the road to just re-do. I'm not saying it's unnecessary but it's sure driving me nutty! ,Are they almost done with it?

My daughter snuk out the window last night. What for? I hope it wasn't for anything dangerous. Cops brought her home this morning.

I'd definitely talk to her about why you didn't allow her to go to that party, and maybe she'll realize that what you're doing is for her own good."
"I want to lose wait and I'm trying to eat less, but just a few minutes ago a had some sugar cravings and ate a whole package of cookies. Yes I understand!  It is so hard to lose weight!

"Last year I was about to run my first 50 mile race.  I had broken my toes a few weeks before and wasn't sure I was going to make it. Ouch, that's unfortunate. Hopefully it turned out okay though? It did, thankfully I had listened to my doctor's recommendations and it healed up just enough.  It was still a pretty nerve wracking start though.","I can imagine, talk about bad timing injuring your toes!"
When I was a kid I threw a rock at a boy. It hit him on the forehead and made a big gash. I felt so bad about doing it. Oh no! Did you get in trouble? It's hard to believe but I didn't.

I felt so badly today because my son overheard me yelling and cursing out his dad because he was late picking up our son.  I didn't mean for him to overhear that but I was really angry.  Aw that's tough!  Have you talked to him about it? I haven't had a chance yet since he's still with his dad.  I hope to call him later tonight. ,It might have upset him but I'm sure he'll understand!  Everyone loses their temper sometimes and it's not like you didn't have a legit reason
"When I was younger, my best friend and I worked together.  She ended up getting the promotion that we both wanted. I am sorry that must have been tough.  She probably felt bad for you.

When all was quiet and the teacher asked if anyone knew the answer, I confidently spoke up, only to be incorrect Oh no how did you feel?

"Don't you hate when you try and help someone with something and then you mess it up? I was trying to ease the burden of housework for my husband this weekend and it didn't go well. Oh no, what happened? I was trying to unclog our sink, got it all taken apart, and then was unable to put it back together again. I had to have him do it when he got home, so it wasn't much help in the end.",Were you at least able to get the clog out?  Hopefully your husband wasn't upset.
"I've had this dirtbike since I was a kid, and took all kinds of care of it. My neighbor backed over it on accident. That must have been upsetting.  Were you able to get it fixed? It's completely mangled. I'm going to try myself, but it doesn't look good. So many years on that thing down the drain. ",I'm so sorry to hear that.  You'll still have the memories at least.
"When I was about seven years old, my cat Hector got out of the house and got lost in the neighborhood. Oh no! Were you able to find him ever?  Unfortunately we weren't. We put out signs but never were able to track him down.","Aw I'm sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is never an easy thing, especially when you don't know what happened to him."
"A friend of mine just won  a lot of money off of a lottery ticket. Oh man that's amazing! How much was it? I hope they share. $10,000.  I feel happy for her, but still wish it had been me instead.",Yeah I'd be in your shoes thinking the same thing as well. That's almost heart stopping news to hear.
"I watched a movie the other night with my kids, they really enjoyed it and we had a lot of cute conversation about it. What was the movie? I'm always looking for something new to watch with my kids! It's called Ponyo. They've been singing a song from it for the last couple of days.",I will have to check it out! Thanks for the suggestion. 
"I recently had to go interview for a job I knew I was under qualified for, so I was fairly nervous going in. I'd have been nervous too.  Did you find out if you got the job? The interview went pretty well, and I did end up getting the job, but I'm gonna have a lot of on the job training to do.",That's awesome.  I'm so happy for you.
"My mom sent me a package the other day that had a bunch of my old comics in it the other day. It was a real trip to go through them all, it brought back a lot of memories. That sounds really great!  Do you like them as much as you remembered? A lot of them were still pretty good, but I think my fondness for them largely hinges on my memories of reading them as a kid.","haha, I felt the same when I read some of my old baby sitter's club books"
"My son's pediatrician told me to call Early Intervention because he's delayed in talking. Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Do they have any idea what the cause may be yet? Not at all.  I'm hoping he'll catch up soon.  The appointment is set for next week and I'm pretty nervous.","I hope it's nothing too serious. My younger brother had the same problem early on, but he turned out to just be a slow developer."
"I found out that a friend of mine from high school passed away recently. I'm sorry to hear that, are you alright? Yeah, I'm doing okay. It hit pretty hard because we were pretty close back then, but had drifted apart the last few years. I wish I hadd taken the time to do more with him.","That's understandable, life goes so fast that it's easy to lose touch with people you care about. All I can do is try to limit that occurrence."
"My daughter starts playing softball this year.  I tried playing when I was younger, but the other girls were mean I had a similar experience playiing little league baseball. How is your daughter feeling about it so far? She's extremely excited about it, but I can't help but be a little bit scared for her after my experience.",I feel you on that. I don't know if I could let my son play baseball after what I went through. I hope your daughter has a better experience.
"When we were kids, my older sister pretended to abandon me at the mall because I was being a brat. Oh no, I had a older cousin who did that to me as well. Hopefully she was just giving you tough love or discipline. Yeah, I definitely deserved it LOL.  I never acted like that again with her!",Yeah it really teaches you! I would always sit down where i was and start crying.
"I was walking to a restaurant to meet with some friends, and on my way there I tripped over a tree branch in front of a bunch of people and looked like a total idiot. When you tripped over the branch, did you get hurt? Only my pride, I fell right on my backside and made a ridiculous noise. ",I hope you were able to laugh about falling and looking silly and not be too embarrassed?
"I always think I want some ""me"" time, but this weekend my husband and our toddler son were both gone and I actually kind of felt bored and sad! Yeah it really isn't for everyone, i like my alone time but only for a while. Afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone. Exactly. We have an infant daughter, but she goes to bed so early that I had a lot of hours of doing nothing in particular. ",Thats the perfect time to just pamper yourself. I cherish those few hours every day!
"My mom made a cake for my brother's birthday so I can't touch it until he eats first. Sounds fair. How hungry are you right now? Pretty hungry, but the cake looks so good so I want even more. Strawberry shortcake style.",Haha I understand. It's like those cartoons where the smell is dragging someone through the air.
"My grandmother passed away 20 years ago.  I just found a quilt she made me when I was a baby Wow what a find, cherish that quilt and keep it safe from harm! It has holes all in it, but I just can't let it go!  It means too much to me.","Yeah, and don't repair it! I think it gives it a history and makes it even more valuable."
"I'm incredibly upset.  I just found out my husband has been cheating on me last week. Oh damn, that sucks. Have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off? We talked long enough for me to tell him it's over.  We can't come back from this, no matter how difficult it will be for me.","Man thats terrible, I hope you can forget about him and find someone better."
"My Ac went out a month ago. I knew it was gonna be during the summer. Were you able to get it fixed? Things break at the most inopportune times! Not yet, I'm working on it because it apparently has to be replaced. I did buy multiple floor fans though.",Well hopefully that is keeping you a little cool!
"My husband and I renewed out wedding vows for our 25th anniversary. It was such a sweet and memory filled day.  Wow! Congratulations! That sounds like a wonderful thing to do. Was it just the two of you? Thank you. No, my grown children were there. They made a slide show of hubby and I over the years. Brought tears to my eyes. ",Aw that is so sweet. That sounds like the most special day. 
"The first time I met my husband I made an absolute fool of myself. I drank way too much. Well, at least he knew what he was getting into right from the start lol. Haha! Very true, although I don't drink much at all now. He must have seen something he liked about me. I, on the other hand, felt horrible about it.",We all have those moments. I'm glad yours worked out so well.
"I just found out I didn't get into the college I wanted to. I'm really disappointed and feel like I should give up Don't give up! You will find a better place and it will be the perfect fit. I'm trying to see that side of it, but it's the only school I wanted to go to",Everything happens for a reason. I think you will realize that and this could be a good thing is disguise.
"I was at the store last week and slipped on some water on the floor I didn't see. I broke my leg! I was mortified!  Oh, no! That's awful! Are you still in pain? Yes, I will need to wear the cast for at least another 5 weeks. People are so rude too. They all just stood there and laughed at me!",I can't believe it! How could they? I'm so sorry to hear that...
"I was walking around with my brother on a Sunday, and I got into a pointless argument with him. I am disappointed that I left myself get caught up in it. I think we all do that with our siblings. I'm sure he knows you still enjoy spending time with him anyway. Yes we talked it over and thought about all the good times we have when we get along!",I'm glad you were able to remedy the situation so easily! I think that shows you have a really good relationship with him.
"I took my daughter to see a circus show at Circus Circus in Reno, and that look on her face was priceless. Oh I've been there! So much fun! I'd like to think that I had that same look when I went there at her age. ",Did you guys play all the carnival games?
"My one year old just learned how to take off her diaper and she smeared poop all over my leg the other day. Oh my god, I bet you were grossed out but laughing at the same time. It was so gross! She had been eating a chocolate granola bar so I thought it was just chocolate. It is funny now, but I was mortified then! ",I really hope that is the last time it happens.
"I found out the other day that I didn't get ther job I interviewed for. thats not good did you aplly for any other jobs? I did, I ended up getting another job I wanted, but I was pretty bummed about losing the other one. The commute would have been much nicer.",I see that is very understandle. 
"My dad gave my son a very special model car and within the week, it was broken. Oh no! I hope no one got in trouble!  He didn't understand, so he wasn't in trouble, but I have to admit I was a little sad about it. ",I'd say so. That's so disheartening. I'm sure it was accidental. 
"My friend moved for a new job recently and she just took her two dogs to a shelter. She didn't even try to find them homes. Well that sucks. I hate it when animals are abandoned. I know, if she couldn't keep them, then at least she could try to find someone to take them in. So sad.","Yeah, that makes me sad too. I feel bad for them because they don't understand why she isn't with them anymore."
"I recently got a promotion. It's quite a big step up from my current role, so I'm very nervous that I won't do well in it.  That is great news. I think you just might be nervous. They wouldn't have promoted you if you couldn't do it. I hope so, everyone tells me I'll do great, but I still have some reservations about it. It's way different than what I do now. I've not been sleeping well. ",Well usually when you think the worst it turns out to be okay. I think you should try and relax.
"A while back I moved from Chicago to Dallas, I was pretty sad to leave. It was my hometown! Big change! both big cities though right? I've always wanted to see that shiny bean thing in chicago.  Yes both are big cities! However Chicago feels less crowded honestly, the metroplex there is more spread out.","I hope you continue to adjust to your new surroundings, maybe you will end up loving Dallas, who knows!"
"A tree fell on my house, shattering my vinyl fence as my kids and I were walking passed it through the garage. Woah I hope no one was hurt No, but everyone was quite frightened.",I bet! Sounds like it would be a big shock
"I was babysitting for someone I really didn't know. When they brought in the car seat, cockroaches crawled out of it. It was so gross!! Ew, that's really disturbing.  The sight of cockroaches always gives me the willies. Me, too! I felt like they were all over me! I can't imagine the house they live in...","Yes, I shudder to think of the condition of the rest of the home if the car seat is like that."
"Woof I am having a hard time as of late. I've been waiting on an acceptance into a video production program and it's driving me up the wall. Oh, that must be nerve-wracking!  It is. A lot of self doubt has crept into my head as of late and I'm trying to fight it off. Patience isn't always a virtue that I am good with either. You should feel confident in your work! I am trying. Thanks for the boost!",Good luck!
My daughter picked a new flavor of ice cream and my friend and I ate it before she even got a bite. Uh oh. Do you think she will be mad when she finds out? I felt so bad that I made my husband go buy her more before she found out!,"Oh she will be none the wiser. But don't feel bad sometimes you have to indulge, and I would figure you still left her some."
"I've been training my cats to use the toilet. At first they were and everyone was super impressed, but now they've forsaken the toilet AND litter box entirely. Wow! So have you tried any methods to get them back on track? Someone might have advice on Youtube. I've been consulting the old youtube for sure, but I think these guys are just rebelling. ","Ah! Sounds like you need a ""Cat Whisperer""!"
"Recently, my dog died. It was so heartbreaking. We had him since 2010. Oh no that would make him quite young. I'm so sorry! Do you have plans for another one when you're ready?  He was a loving dog. Probably! I would love to get a Labrador Retriever. ","Those are awesome dogs, I've known quite a few in my life. Well whenever you're ready I think it'll be a perfect match."
"My husband had a job interview a few days ago...now we are waiting... Ahh that's so anxiety-making. I hope he gets the jon. Me, too! The anticipation is killing me!!!",Fingers crossed!
I was only asleep for an hour last night and I jumped out of bed! There was this smacking noise on my window it freaked me out! Yikes! did you figure out what it was? You'll never guess haha! It was just a twig. The age old branch slapping on the window in the wind. ,It must have been awfully windy.
"I was home by myself when the power went out and I heard a strange noise! Oh, that sounds scary! Did you find out what it was? No. I was too scared to look so I looked myself in my bedroom.",Well it was probably nothing to worry about because you seem alright now. :)
"I had to give a speech to over 300 people in front of my church. Wow, that's a lot of people. I was so nervous! I get very shy around crowds! ",I know the feeling. I get sick around crowds.
I went for a run the other day and a dog chased me while I was pushing my baby in the stroller! I would have been so scared!  I don't understand having dogs off leash. It was terrifying! I was so mad. The owner was nowhere to be found. ,"So reckless!  It's really not that hard to leash dogs.  And with the baby there too, ugh.  I can't imagine."
"My nephew was racing around our house, like he has a million times before, and someone took a bad fall into the corner of a bookcase.  I had to take him to the ER. Ouch! Kids have a tendency to learn things the hard way. Was he okay? Yes, luckily it looked much worse than it actually was!",That's good! My son is always running into stuff! He needs bubblewrap to keep him safe.
My son went off to college. I found a baby picture of him and it made me sad. I'm sorry. They grow up fast. Its hard to watch them leave the nest. I guess I need to find a hobby to keep me busy!,That can help. I know I like my hobbies lol.
I had an interview and I forgot a portion of what I was saying. It was a little awkward. Oh no ! Were you able to come up with something else to say ? Yes! I think I recovered okay. I just moved on to my next statement. It's a bummer freezing up though!,"I understand, but I bet you did well in spite of that !"
"I had to ask my teacher if she would mind going over a assinment again with mme Wow! That must have taken a lot of guts, but I hope it was worthwhile. Yeah it was good for me but i was nervous to ask ","Oh no, why were you so scared?"
"One time when I was in middle school, my friend was making fun of me. So, I pulled his pants down. Oh my! Well, I bet he quit making fun of you in light of his own embarrassment. Actually, he stopped making fun of me because he was an alien.",An alien? Wow.
"When I moved to a new town, it was hard to make new friends? That sounds difficult. Did you try talking to people in your neighborhood? Yes, they are all old.",That always sucks. But old people are great and sometimes funny to hang out with. Maybe you should try giving them a go!
My brothers wife left him and took off with the baby. Oh wow! That really sounds like your brother is going through a rough time. He is. Its hard on all of us. ,"I hope everything works out, family is everything."
"My high school friend hit my car. Ah, that is terrible! I guess it was their fault? What did you do? Yes it was 100% her fault. They hit my car that she let me park in her driveway! She should have been more careful.","Wow, hopefully you both have insurance. "
"Today I visited a campus where I used to work, it was good to be there and I kind of missed the old times! Ahh, do you still have friends there? Yes Maybe you can visit them more often because you like it there so much. Yes, I could, but it's not quite the same when you don't actually work there any more. ","Yeah, I guess. take care my friend."
"Someone pulled out in front of me and hit my car! Oh no that's terrible! Are you okay? Yes, I was coming around a curve and they just pulled out. My car is totaled though.","I'm glad you weren't injured, but it really sucks that your car is totaled. I hope you have a reliable mode of transportation!"
So i was out last night running and i felt my pants ripe Oh no! Were you close to home? yeah but still i had to cover myself,At least you had something to cover yourself with!
"I was at a relatives funeral and during a rendition of Amazing Grace, I accidentally passed gas very loudly. im sorry to hear that. did everyone know you did it? Definitely. It was awful.",well you cant help it and it happens sometimes
My first baby just turned 11 yesterday. I can't believe she is a pre-teen now. I feel like she was just a baby not too long ago. They grow up so fast! Have you noticed differences in her personality now that she's getting older? Yes! She cares about her appearence more than ever and wants to shave her legs. She also has more of an attitude. Sometmes it's intentional and sometimes its not. ,Its a hard age for girls as I'm sure you remember. At least she has a good mom to guide her!
I am thinking of getting this polaris slingshot I have been wanting. Hence the Mturking. I'm not sure if I will be able to afford it though Oh yes you can. Just keep turking and you will get there for sure even if you have to work extra hours in the night. maybe I could get the 2035 year model haha I promise it is possible if you really want it. Show me how bad you want it!! That's true! I wish I could find something else that pays better.  ,You can manifest anything your heart desires.
this guy cut me off today and we were in traffic What did you do? i was made and wanted to say some mean things but i didnt,Thats probably best not to confront them. People are so quick to kill you these days
E must have been off his meds or something Why? Did he do something erratic or dangerous? I asked him for his insurance card,That was probably a good idea. Did he give it to you?
so last night my football team lost it was awful Sports Fan are you !  I've lost many bets / honey do challenges to my football team as well ! I hope you feel better. yeah it happens but it doesnt feel good,Perhaps next week your team will WIN ! Lets both think positive thoughts for now :)
 My neighbor just purchased a new truck while i'm still riding around in my 2005 Honda Accord ! Well at least yours is paid off and he is still paying on his That is true.  Mine does not always work well. I would enjoy his comfortable seats and being able to make phone calls through the voice in my car stereo,Well maybe give it a little TLC and there you go
"I won $25 on a lottery ticket and when I went out to cash it, I lost it! I tried to find it but it was gone.  oh man what a bummer! i hate when things like that happen! Me too. I was going to put that $25 in my gas tank. ",keep your head up im sure another lucky break will come along!

A neighbor eventually brought it inside, but unfortunately, he didn't know how to care for cats. ",The kitten might have been dehydrated.  Hopefully the neighbor called someone else to come help?
im waiting for a test work to come back and im kinda sweating it I hope the results are good. What were you getting tested for? it is blood work. very serious blood work,"Don't sweat too hard. Try to focus on positive aspects of life right now, because whatever happens that positivity will carry you."
I went to a rural school out in the middle of nowhere. I had to transfer due to how overwhelmingly exclusive it was. did your parents have to pay to send you elsewere?

Last night I was going through my son's memory box and I found his report card from 4th grade. He was always in some kind of mischief. Always makes me smile to read these memories. They grow up so quickly!  How old is he now? He just started 6th grade! I can only imagine what the year will bring. That's a tough transition. ,"Yeah, mine just started 5th and he's in a different building and changing classes and it's a huge difference from 4th grade."
"I was at my sons school for an event. A child threw up right in front of me. wow that must be gross, i know it would make me feel like throwing up too It was. I couldn't get out of there fast enough!","don't blame you, but as a parent you must see a lot of gross things coming from kids"

"I haven't been getting much sleep lately. Part of my rent on a farm property I live on is making sure hunters don't sneak onto the property. They always sneak in at the worst times. Have you set up cameras to monitor the property? Yeah those help me a lot as far as getting to them early, but they are just constantly at it! It's not even hunting season. ",Maybe report what is going on to the local PD?
"I went to the grocery store last week, which is 30 miles away from my house, and when I got home, I discovered I was overcharged by $20. That made me mad!  That's terrible!

At least you'll get your money back eventually.
I forgot my brothers birthday and I tried to cover it up but he knew. I called him the next day but it wasn't the same. Oh no! I hate when that happens. Happens to me all the time. Did he forgive you? Yes. But he brings it up when he wants to mess with me. ,That's not very nice of him. Is he older or younger?
"So  last Halloween i ate all my kids candy while they were asleep that sounded like an ambitious endeavor, you must have felt sick afterwards yeah and i was worried so i went out that morning and bought them more candy to replace it","they will never know, as long they have candy and you can keep your dark secret to yourself"

Yeah it is a solid art for sure. and i still had to pay her. i feel like i got hustled. ",I'd try to get a refund!
My mom got scammed out of hundreds of dollars. Dude! That sucks! I am so sorry about that. What happened? It was some internet phishing thing.  She had zero recourse.

My friend lost her oldest son in a car wreck a few days ago. I can't imagine the pain she is feeling. OMG that is horrible! :( Im sure she needs you right now I have been praying a lot.

I am starting a new job and am so nervous but equally excited. That's great. I hope you do well in your new job. Thank you.  It was a tough decision to leave my current job though. ,"I'm sure it was, but it always a great idea to be looking to improve yourself or your position. Do what is best for you."
My kids started school last Tuesday and no school supply lists were put out online or in stores. I didn't get a list until 4 days before school started.

"I was driving the other day on a lane highway and a truck was tailgating me, flashing lights, and honking. I was already going 10 over the speed limit and it's not like I could get over. I hate aggressive drivers. They cause the majority of the accidents. Me too. It made me really angry I slowed down on purpose and after about 10minutes he was able to pass me. He must have been in a real hurry. ",He probably had no where to go important. He was just being rude.
I shot a roll on 35mm film. I was very excited to see the results. That sounds like fun. What were you taking pictures of? I didn't know film existed anymore lol Its still around.

"Since I broke up with my girlfriend, I feel bad been alone. First Im sorry for your heartbreak, but second... its okay to be alone to let the feelings pass. How long has it been?  It is recent.

"I was in Kiev last year walking back to my hostel. Two drunk men started following me. That sounds very scary, what happened?  I was a little bit worried.

" My friend always gets everything before me. I swear, everything from me wanting a certain car to wanting a baby and she always gets it before me.  How are you still friends? Sometimes I question it to because no one else makes me feel like they intentionally do things like this. ",I have a few friends who are way better off than I am. It makes me a bit sad about my situation. 
"I found some old pictures a few weeks back and they made me think about my childhood. It's great looking through old photo albums and remembering all those great times. Yes, it really is. It's a shame we don't print out pictures today like we used to. ",Yeah it really is. We just slap everything on our computer or online these days. It's just not the same.
I went to a party at a friends house and I spilled a drink on the floor. Hey it happens to the best of us. Were you able to clean it up well? I wasn't.

It is time to burn your house down and start a new life elsewhere.
 I was staying at a hostel and someone forgot their nice pair of sunglasses. I took it. And how did you feel about taking another person's forgotten belongings? Indifferent mostly. They flew out so they werent coming back. ,That's a good way of seeing it I suppose.

"I met a stranger once. He asked me for a ride to the store. That could be creepy depending on the person. I'm extra paranoid though. Yes, I was very skeptical. He didn't appear trustworthy at all.","That's understandable, there's just no way to be sure what a stranger's intentions are."
"I was in Walmart and my son pulled a few items off the shelf. Everyone was looking and whispering. Kids like touching and looking at things, I'm sure no real harm was done. People like making a big deal out of everything. And it was mostly the older folks, I tried to put the things back on the shelf. ",I'd say ignore them as best as you can. It's normal for kids to do these kind of things!
"I had to go to a new doctor last week. I was a little nervous and unsure going in I am usually that way, whenever I have a doctor's appointment. I hope everything went well. It did, It was nothing to worry about",Ah. There you go so you were worried about nothing. I am glad that all was well.

"While I was at the grocery store I was in line behind a nice, but very confused older person who had trouble getting their credit card to work. That can be frustrating. Did you do anything to help?

","Oh that is terrible, cashiers should have more patience."
"I ate my brother's last piece of birthday cake, knowing he really wanted it. Was the cake that good, or were you trying to make him angry? The cake was just really good. I felt pretty bad afterwards.",Maybe you could make it up to him. I'm sure he'll get over it though. 
"A homeless person begged me for money the other day. I guess he really need it. Did you give him the money?   I wasn't sure if I should give it to him because I didn't want him to spend it on drugs or something, but I did end up giving him 2 dollars.","Well, at least you gave him something. He could buy a burger at McDonald's"
Im getting sick of my neighbor. every morning he revs his engine over and over again. I dislike people who do that. I never understood why! Have you tried talking to him? You cant talk to this guy trust me.,Oh I believe you. Typically those type of people aren't people you can reason with.

He didn't get me anything, he said he was short on cash.  ","Thats not ok I have been in that situation before and have made my girlfriend a card, wrote her a poem something. "
Im so sick of my brother. he accused me of taking his money today That is not cool at all. Why would he say that? Maybe he misplaced it. He probably lost it! I would never take anything for anyone!,That must have made you feel angry. I am sorry that happened to you but please forgive him.
"I read a book the other day and it made me feel all warm inside. I love good books, what was it about? It was about a child who was killed by a drunk driver, then ended up donating her organs that ended up saving the man who hit and killed her. I love books and movies that evoke many emotions. ","That sounds really deep and dramatic, I think I would like that one. You might like books like ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" also."
I had to work late the other night and had to walk outside to my car alone. I imagine that would be a bit unnerving. It being dark and anything being possible. It was very dark and I kept hearing strange noises.,"That sounds creepy, I would have to start keeping protection with me just in case."
"I told my crush that I was into her and wanted to take her out. Did she accept? I'm sure you would be great to go out with. No, she was not interested.

"My son had always done so well in school. That is good, is he struggling now? Yes, lately he has been slacking off it seems and he failed a test.","Did you ask him about it, or did he make a big change to high school. Sometimes a big change or just burn out can kick in."

I used to be really open and honest about my feelings around other people.  Now I keep them to myself and feel a ton better Why is that? Lacking control of your emotions makes you weak,"I suppose that is true to an extent, that makes sense"
I accidentally droped a dumbell on my toe at the gym. I felt so freaking stupid. Did it hurt though Yeah it hurt and I was listening to music so I might have yelled a cuss word loudly. ,"I am sorry, I would cuss too if it happened to me"
"I opened my front door and saw a big snake, I immediately slammed the door and went back in. That is so scary. I don't know what I would have done, It makes me shiver, just thinking about it. I called animal control. ",You did the right thing. I wouldn't have been able to stop thinking about it.

"I used to get nervous and anxious whenever someone would try to start a fight or argument with me...now I don't ever back down, and it helps I've been boxing and wrestling for 5 years I am glad to hear that.

I told my husband that I was going to see a friend when I didn't. I went to a party planner's place. Are you going to have a surprise party? Yes!

I used to be miserable when no one would hit me up and I'd spend the weekend solo at my parents' house...now I turn off my phone just to keep from getting distracted That sounds sad.

As long as you have a safe roof over your head and your family is happy, that's all that matters!"
 I had someone break into my garage the other day. Oh no.  Did they do damage or steal anything? They stole my kids bikes and some tools.  It is scary to think they were that close to my house.  I have beefed up the security since then.,That is definitely scary.  I don't understand why people want to steal from others.  Get a dang job!
Buddy of mine and I had both paid for front row tickets to a concert...I was so mad at myself when we got there and I forgot it back home Oh that sucks! How far do you live from the venue? At the time I lived almost an hour away and parking was packed so I knew it was a lost cause...ended up getting some chick's number at the bar later though lol,Sorry you missed the concert.

Herbs too, they're all healing and helpful to the body."

He did, when he came back I was mad but he really picked up the rest of the day leaving me little work","Well that's good, at least he didn't do it on purpose.

I have a coworker that plays their music so loud I can hear it from their headphones. I keep asking them to turn it down but they keep cranking it back up. That must make you angry.
